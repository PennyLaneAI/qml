    :title: Layerwise learning for quantum neural networks
    :author: Felipe Oyarce Andrade
    :date: 26/01/2021
    :code: https://github.com/felipeoyarce/layerwise-learning

    In this project we’ve implemented a strategy presented by <a
    href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14904" target="_blank">Skolik et al., 2020</a> for
    effectively training quantum neural networks. In layerwise learning the
    strategy is to gradually increase the number of parameters by adding a few
    layers and training them while freezing the parameters of previous layers
    already trained.  An easy way for understanding this technique is to think
    that we’re dividing the problem into smaller circuits to successfully avoid
    falling into Barren Plateaus. We provide a proof-of-concept
    implementation of this technique in Pennylane’s Pytorch interface for binary
    classification in the MNIST dataset.

    :title: A Quantum-Enhanced Transformer

    The Transformer neural network architecture revolutionized the analysis of
    text. Here we show an example of a Transformer with quantum-enhanced
    multi-headed attention. In the quantum-enhanced version, dense layers are
    replaced by simple Variational Quantum Circuits. An implementation based on
    PennyLane and TensorFlow-2.x illustrates the basic concept.

    :title: A Quantum-Enhanced LSTM Layer

    In Natural Language Processing, documents are usually presented as sequences
    of words.  One of the most successful techniques to manipulate this kind of
    data is the Recurrent Neural Network architecture, and in particular a
    variant called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Using the PennyLane library
    and its PyTorch interface, one can easily define a LSTM network where
    Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) replace linear operations. An
    application to Part-of-Speech tagging is presented in this tutorial.

    :title: Quantum Machine Learning Model Predictor for Continuous Variables
    :author: Roberth Saénz Pérez Alvarado
    :date: 16/12/2020
    :code: https://github.com/roberth2018/Quantum-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Quantum_Machine_Learning_Model_Predictor_for_Continuous_Variable_.ipynb
    :color: heavy-rain-gradient

    According to the paper "Predicting toxicity by quantum machine learning"
    (Teppei Suzuki, Michio Katouda 2020), it is possible to predict continuous
    variables—like those in the continuous-variable quantum neural network model
    described in Killoran et al.  (2018)—using 2 qubits per feature. This is
    done by applying encodings, variational circuits, and some linear
    transformations on expectation values in order to predict values close to
    the real target.  Based on an <a
    href="https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/quantum_neural_net.html">example</a>
    from PennyLane, and using a small dataset which consists of a
    one-dimensional feature and one output (so that the processing does not take
    too much time), the algorithm showed reliable results.

    :title: Trainable Quanvolutional Neural Networks
    :author: Denny Mattern, Darya Martyniuk, Fabian Bergmann, and Henri Willems
    :date: 26/11/2020
    :code: https://github.com/PlanQK/TrainableQuantumConvolution
    :color: heavy-rain-gradient

    We implement a trainable version of Quanvolutional Neural Networks using
    parametrized <code>RandomCircuits</code>. Parameters are optimized using
    standard gradient descent. Our code is based on the <a
    href="https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_quanvolution.html">Quanvolutional
    Neural Networks</a> demo by Andrea Mari. This demo results from our research
    as part of the <a href="https://www.planqk.de">PlanQK consortium</a>.

    :title: Using a Keras optimizer for Iris classification with a QNode and loss function
    :author: Hemant Gahankari
    :date: 09/11/2020
    :code: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17Qri3jUBpjjkhmO6ZZZNXwm511svSVPw?usp=sharing
    :color: heavy-rain-gradient

    Using PennyLane, we explain how to create a quantum function and train a
    quantum function using a Keras optimizer directly, i.e., not using a Keras
    layer. The objective is to train a quantum function to predict classes of
    the Iris dataset.

    :title: Linear regression using angle embedding and a single qubit

    :code: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ABVtBjwcGNNIfmiwEXRdFdZ47K1vZ978?usp=sharing
    :color: heavy-rain-gradient

    In this example, we create a hybrid neural network (mix of classical and
    quantum layers), train it and get predictions from it. The data set
    consists of temperature readings in degrees Centigrade and corresponding
    Fahrenheit. The objective is to train a neural network that predicts
    Fahrenheit values given Centigrade values.

    :title: Amplitude embedding in Iris classification with PennyLane's KerasLayer
    :author: Hemant Gahankari

    :color: heavy-rain-gradient

    Using amplitude embedding from PennyLane, this demonstration aims to explain
    how to pass classical data into the quantum function and convert it to quantum
    data. It also shows how to create a PennyLane KerasLayer from a QNode, train it
    and check the performance of the model.

    :title: Characterizing the loss landscape of variational quantum circuits
    :author: Patrick Huembeli and Alexandre Dauphin
    :date: 30/09/2020
    :code: https://github.com/PatrickHuembeli/vqc_loss_landscapes
    :paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02785
    :color: heavy-rain-gradient

    Using PennyLane and complex PyTorch, we compute the Hessian of the loss
    function of VQCs and show how to characterize the loss landscape with it. We
    show how the Hessian can be used to escape flat regions of the loss
    landscape.


.. If the final card deck only has a single card, we insert a 'hidden card'
   so that the card does not become full-width.

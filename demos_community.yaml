    This is a binary classification hybrid model as proposed in the paper
    "Continuous Variable Quantum Neural Networks", composed of 2 layers of feed forward 
    classical layers and 4 layers of quantum neural network. Using the Pennylane Tensorflow plug-in, 
    the whole network is wrapped as a Keras sequential network, whose parameters are updated via 
    Keras's built in loss function and optimizer.

  description: |
    The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is an algorithm for searching the
    ground state of a quantum system. The SSVQE uses a simple technique to find
    the excited energy states by transforming the |0⋯0⟩ to the ground state,
    and another orthogonal basis state |0⋯1⟩ to the first excited state and so on.
    As a demonstration, the weighted SSVQE is used to find out the excited states
    of a transverse Ising model with 4 spins and that of the hydrogen molecule.

    Reinforcement Learning as quantum control leverages quantum hybrid circuits
    (QHC) for creating optimizations on policy networks for Deep RL.
    Policy-gradient-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are well suited
    for optimizing the variational parameters of QAOA in a noise-robust fashion,
    opening up the way for developing RL techniques for continuous quantum control.
    This is advantageous to help mitigate and monitor the potentially unknown
    sources of errors in modern quantum simulators. This demo aims to provide an
    implementation of PPO on policy algorithm with QHC for continuous control.

    VQE is currently one of the most widely used algorithms for optimizing
    problems using quantum computers. A necessary step in this algorithm is
    calculating the expectation value given a state, which is calculated by
    decomposing the Hamiltonian into Pauli operators and obtaining this value for
    each of them. In this work, we have designed an algorithm capable of figuring
    this value using a single circuit. A time cost study has been carried out, and
    it has been found that in certain more complex Hamiltonians, it is possible to
    obtain a good performance over the current methods.

    The Meta-VQE algorithm is a variational quantum algorithm that is suited for NISQ devices 
    and encodes parameters of a Hamiltonian into a variational ansatz. We can obtain good 
    estimations of the ground state of the Hamiltonian by changing only those encoded parameters.

    This work explores variational quantum circuits for deep reinforcement learning.
    Specifically, we reshape classical deep reinforcement learning algorithms like
    experience replay and target network into a representation of variational quantum
    circuits. Moreover, we use a quantum information encoding scheme to reduce the number of
    model parameters compared to classical neural networks. To the best of our knowledge,
    this work is the first proof-of-principle demonstration of variational quantum circuits
    to approximate the deep Q-value function for decision-making and policy-selection
    reinforcement learning with experience replay and target network. Besides, our
    variational quantum circuits can be deployed in many near-term NISQ machines.

    We train a hybrid quantum convolution neural network (QCNN) on acoustic data with up to 10,000
    features. This model uses layers of random quantum gates to efficiently encode convolutional
    features. We perform a neural saliency analysis to provide a classical activation mapping to
    compare classical and quantum models, illustrating that the QCNN self-attention model did learn
    meaningful representations. An additional connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss on
    character recognition is also provided for continuous speech recognition.

    In this project we’ve implemented a strategy presented by <a
    href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14904" target="_blank">Skolik et al., 2020</a> for
    effectively training quantum neural networks. In layerwise learning the
    strategy is to gradually increase the number of parameters by adding a few
    layers and training them while freezing the parameters of previous layers
    already trained.  An easy way for understanding this technique is to think
    that we’re dividing the problem into smaller circuits to successfully avoid
    falling into Barren Plateaus. We provide a proof-of-concept
    implementation of this technique in Pennylane’s Pytorch interface for binary
    classification in the MNIST dataset.

    In Natural Language Processing, documents are usually presented as sequences
    of words.  One of the most successful techniques to manipulate this kind of
    data is the Recurrent Neural Network architecture, and in particular a
    variant called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Using the PennyLane library
    and its PyTorch interface, one can easily define a LSTM network where
    Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) replace linear operations. An
    application to Part-of-Speech tagging is presented in this tutorial.

    According to the paper "Predicting toxicity by quantum machine learning"
    (Teppei Suzuki, Michio Katouda 2020), it is possible to predict continuous
    variables—like those in the continuous-variable quantum neural network model
    described in Killoran et al.  (2018)—using 2 qubits per feature. This is
    done by applying encodings, variational circuits, and some linear
    transformations on expectation values in order to predict values close to
    the real target.  Based on an <a
      href="https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/quantum_neural_net.html">example</a>
    from PennyLane, and using a small dataset which consists of a
    one-dimensional feature and one output (so that the processing does not take
    too much time), the algorithm showed reliable results.

    :title: What are quantum computers, and how can we train them in Python?
    :author: Josh Izaac (Xanadu)

    Using a mixture of real Python examples and illustrated diagrams, we show how to not only evaluate,
    but also differentiate small quantum programs directly on quantum hardware. By extracting the gradients,
    we can integrate these quantum programs directly into larger differentiable programs in Python, and
    train/optimize the full (hybrid quantum-classical!) program.

    :title: Using Multiple QPUs
    :author: Nathan Killoran (Xanadu)

    What would you do with 1000 QPUs? In the latest release of PennyLane,
    we've introduced a number of new features to make computations involving multiple QPUs more
    seamless and accessible. See a number of simple ideas and use-cases where many QPUs could
    provide a benefit over a single QPU, even for today's small and noisy devices.

    :title: Welcome to QHACK'19
    :author: Nathan Killoran (Xanadu)

    The Xanadu team hosted its first quantum machine learning hackathon, QHACK, from
    Nov 25–26, 2019, bringing together experts and enthusiasts in quantum computing
    and quantum machine learning.

    :title: Quantum Gates and Gradients
    :author: Gavin Crooks (X, The Moonshot Factory)

    See how the space of all 2-qubit gates can be mapped to a pyramid—which
    can be printed and folded for personal reference! By using known 2-qubit gate
    decompositions, the parameter-shift rule for calculating quantum gradients
    on hardware can be extended to any 2-qubit unitary operation.

    :title: Barren Plateau Issues for Variational Quantum-Classical Algorithms
    :author: Patrick Coles (Los Alamos National Lab)

    In order to train quantum circuits, we need to pay careful attention to the cost functions
    that we choose to optimize, otherwise the training can suffer from barren plateau problems.

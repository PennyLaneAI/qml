    :title: Using Multiple QPUs
    :author: Nathan Killoran (Xanadu)

    What would you do with 1000 QPUs? In the latest release of PennyLane,
    we’ve introduced a number of new features to make computations involving multiple QPUs more
    seamless and accessible. See a number of simple ideas and use-cases where many QPUs could
    provide a benefit over a single QPU, even for today’s small and noisy devices.

    :title: Welcome to QHACK'19
    :author: Nathan Killoran (Xanadu)

    The Xanadu team hosted its first quantum machine learning hackathon, QHACK, from
    Nov 25–26, 2019, bringing together experts and enthusiasts in quantum computing
    and quantum machine learning.

    :title: Quantum Gates and Gradients
    :author: Gavin Crooks (X, The Moonshot Factory)

    See how the space of all 2-qubit gates can be mapped to a pyramid --- which
    can be printed and folded for personal reference! By using known 2-qubit gate
    decompositions, the parameter-shift rule for calculating quantum gradients
    on hardware can be extended to any 2-qubit unitary operation.

    :title: Quantum Machine Learning with PennyLane
    :author: Josh Izaac (Xanadu)

    A 20 minute crash-course on PennyLane, its features,
    and how it can be used to streamline quantum machine learning.

    :title: PennyLane - Automatic differentiation and machine learning of quantum computations
    :author: Josh Izaac (Xanadu)

    Introducing PennyLane, a Python-based software framework for optimization and
    machine learning of quantum and hybrid quantum-classical computations.

.. youtube:: Xh9pUu3-WxM
    :title: Innovating machine learning with near-term quantum computing
    :author: Maria Schuld (Xanadu)

    Explore different aspects of variational quantum machine learning
    algorithms, including their role in the development of near-term quantum technologies,
    strategies of automatic differentiation, and how to integrate quantum circuits with
    machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch and Tensorflow using open-source software.

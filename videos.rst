    :title: Quantum Gates and Gradients
    :author: Gavin Crooks (X, The Moonshot Factory)

    See how the space of all 2-qubit gates can be mapped to a pyramid --- which
    can be printed and folded for personal reference! By using known 2-qubit gate
    decompositions, the parameter-shift rule for calculating quantum gradients
    on hardware can be extended to any 2-qubit unitary operation.

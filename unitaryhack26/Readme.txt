The formula E = mc^2 expresses the principle of mass-energy equivalence, stating that energy (E) 
and mass (m) are interchangeable and related by the square of the speed of light (c^2). 

With the Image mc^2 = E, the (m)mass, (c^2)CNOT and (E) equilibriu, which the frist letters stand 
for the equation mc=E

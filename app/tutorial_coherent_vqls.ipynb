        "\n\nCoherent Variational Quantum Linear Solver\n==========================================\n*Author: Andrea Mari*\n\nIn this tutorial we propose and implement an algorithm that we call\n*coherent variational quantum linear solver* (CVQLS). \nThis is inspired by the VQLS proposed in Ref. [1] (implemented in a :doc:`previous demo <tutorial_vqls>`), with an important difference: \nthe matrix $A$ associated to the problem is physically \napplied as a probabilistic coherent operation. This approach has some advantages and\ndisadvantages and its practical convenience depends on the specific linear problem \nto be solved and on experimental constraints.\n\n.. figure:: ../implementations/coherent_vqls/cvqls_circuit.png\n    :align: center\n    :width: 100%\n    :target: javascript:void(0)\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nWe first define the problem and the general structure of the CVQLS. \nAs a second step, we consider a particular case and we solve it explicitly with PennyLane.\n\nThe problem\n^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWe are given a $2^n \\times 2^n$ matrix $A$ which can be expressed as a linear\ncombination of $L$ unitary matrices $A_0, A_1, \\dots A_{L-1}$, i.e.,\n\n\\begin{align}A = \\sum_{l=0}^{L-1} c_l A_l,\\end{align}\n\nwhere $c_l$ are arbitrary complex numbers. Importantly, we assume that each of the\nunitary components $A_l$ can be efficiently implemented with a quantum circuit\nacting on $n$ qubits.\n\nWe are also given a normalized complex vector in the physical form of a quantum\nstate $|b\\rangle$, which can be generated by a unitary operation $U$\napplied to the ground state of $n$ qubits. , i.e.,\n\n\\begin{align}|b\\rangle = U_b |0\\rangle,\\end{align}\n\nwhere again we assume that $U_b$ can be efficiently implemented with a quantum circuit.\n\nThe problem that we aim to solve is that of preparing a quantum state $|x\\rangle$, such that\n$A |x\\rangle$ is proportional to $|b\\rangle$ or, equivalently, such that\n\n\\begin{align}|\\Psi\\rangle :=  \\frac{A |x\\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle x |A^\\dagger A |x\\rangle}} \\approx |b\\rangle.\\end{align}\n\n\nCoherent Variational Quantum Linear Solver (CVQLS)\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWe approximate the solution $|x\\rangle$ with a variational quantum\ncircuit, i.e., a unitary circuit $V$ depending on a finite number of classical real parameters\n$w = (w_0, w_1, \\dots)$:\n\n\\begin{align}|x \\rangle = V(w) |0\\rangle.\\end{align}\n\nThe parameters should be optimized in order to maximize the overlap between the quantum states\n$|\\Psi\\rangle$ and $|b\\rangle$. We define the following cost function,\n\n\\begin{align}C = 1- |\\langle b | \\Psi \\rangle|^2,\\end{align}\n\nsuch that its minimization with respect to the variational parameters should lead towards the problem solution.\n\nThe approach used in Ref. [1] is to decompose the cost function in terms of many expectation values associated to the\nindividual components $A_l$ of the problem matrix $A$. For this reason, in the VQLS of Ref. [1],\nthe state vector proportional to $A |x\\rangle$ is not physically prepared.\nOn the contrary, the idea presented in this tutorial is to physically implement the linear map $A$ as\na coherent probabilistic operation. This approach allows to prepare the state \n$|\\Psi\\rangle :=  A |x\\rangle/\\sqrt{\\langle x |A^\\dagger A |x\\rangle}$ which can be used to estimate the\ncost function of the problem in a more direct way.\n\n\nCoherently applying $A$\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nThe problem of coherently applying a liner combination of unitary operations has been already studied in Ref. [2]\nand here we follow a very similar approach.\n\nWithout loss of generality we can assume that the coefficients $c=(c_1, c_2, \\dots c_L)$ appearing\nin the definition of $A$ represent a positive and normalized probability distribution, i.e.,\n\n\\begin{align}c_l \\ge 0 \\quad \\forall l,  \\qquad \\sum_{l=0}^{L-1} c_l=1.\\end{align}\n\nIndeed the complex phase of each coefficient $c_l$ can always be absorbed into the associated unitary $A_l$, obtaining\nin this way a vector of positive values. Moreover, since the linear problem is \ndefined up to a constant scaling factor, we can also normalize the coefficients to get a probability distribution.\n\nFor simplicity, since we can always pad $c$ with additional zeros, we assume that $L=2^m$ for some positive integer $m$.\n\nLet us consider a unitary circuit $U_c$, embedding the square root of $c$ into the quantum state $|\\sqrt{c}\\rangle$ of $m$ ancillary qubits:\n\n\\begin{align}|\\sqrt{c} \\rangle =  U_c |0\\rangle = \\sum_{l=0}^{L-1} \\sqrt{c_l} | l \\rangle,\\end{align}\n\nwhere $\\{ |l\\rangle \\}$ is the computational basis of the ancillary system.\n\n\nNow, for each component $A_l$ of the problem matrix $A$, we can define an associated controlled unitary operation $CA_l$,\nacting on the system and on the ancillary basis states as follows:\n\n\\begin{align}CA_l \\, |j\\rangle |l' \\rangle  = \n    \\Bigg\\{\n    \\begin{array}{c}\n    \\left(A_l \\otimes \\mathbb{I}\\right) \\; |j\\rangle |l \\rangle \\quad \\; \\mathrm{for}\\; l'=l \\\\\n    \\qquad \\qquad |j\\rangle |l' \\rangle  \\quad \\mathrm{for}\\; l'\\neq l \n    \\end{array},\\end{align}\n\ni.e., the unitary $A_l$ is applied only when the ancillary system is in the corresponding basis state $|l\\rangle$.\n\nA natural generalization of the `Hadamard test <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_test_(quantum_computation)>`_, to the case of multiple unitary operations, is the following\n(see also the figure at the top of this tutorial):\n\n1. Prepare all qubits in the ground state.\n2. Apply $U_c$ to the ancillary qubits.\n3. Apply the variational circuit $V$ to the system qubits.\n4. Apply all the controlled unitaries $CA_l$ for all values of $l$.\n5. Apply $U_c^\\dagger$ to the ancillary qubits.\n6. Measure the ancillary qubits in the computational basis.\n7. If the outcome of the measurement is the ground state, the system collapses to\n   $|\\Psi\\rangle :=  A |x\\rangle/\\sqrt{\\langle x |A^\\dagger A |x\\rangle}$.\n   If the outcome is not the ground state, the experiment should be repeated.\n\n\nEstimating the cost function\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nFrom a technical point of view, the previous steps represent the most difficult part of the algorithm. \nOnce we have at our disposal the quantum system prepared in the state $|\\Psi\\rangle$,\nit is very easy to compute the cost function.\nIndeed one could simply continue the previous protocol with the following two steps:\n\n8. Apply $U_b^\\dagger$ to the system.\n9. Measure the system in the computational basis. The probability of finding it\n   in the ground state (given the ancillary qubits measured in their ground state),\n   is $|\\langle 0 | U_b^\\dagger |\\Psi \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle b | \\Psi \\rangle|^2$.\n\nSo, with sufficiently many shots of the previous experiment, one can directly estimate\nthe cost function of the problem.\n\nImportantly, the operations of steps 7 and 8 commute. Therefore all the measurements can be\ndelayed until the end of the quantum circuit (as shown in the figure at the top of this tutorial),\nmaking the structure of the experiment more straightforward.  \n\nA simple example\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nIn this tutorial we apply the previous theory to the following simple example \nbased on a system of 3 qubits, which was already considered in Ref. [1] and also reproduced in PennyLane (:doc:`VQLS <tutorial_vqls>`):\n\n\\begin{align}\\begin{align}\n        A  &=  c_0 A_0 + c_1 A_1 + c_2 A_2 = \\mathbb{I} + 0.2 X_0 Z_1 + 0.2 X_0, \\\\\n        \\\\\n        |b\\rangle &= U_b |0 \\rangle = H_0  H_1  H_2 |0\\rangle,\n        \\end{align}\\end{align}\n\nwhere $Z_j, X_j, H_j$ represent the Pauli $Z$, Pauli $X$ and Hadamard gates applied to the qubit with index $j$.\n\nThis problem is computationally quite easy since a single layer of local rotations is enough to generate the\nsolution state, i.e., we can use the following simple ansatz:\n\n\\begin{align}|x\\rangle = V(w) |0\\rangle = \\Big [  R_y(w_0) \\otimes  R_y(w_1) \\otimes  R_y(w_2) \\Big ]  H_0  H_1  H_2 |0\\rangle.\\end{align}\n\n\nIn the code presented below we solve this particular problem, by following the general scheme of the CVQLS previously discussed.\nEventually we will compare the quantum solution with the classical one.\n\nGeneral setup\n-------------\nThis Python code requires *PennyLane* and the plotting library *matplotlib*.\n"

This repository contains introductory materials on Quantum Machine Learning, as well as Python code
demos using [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai), a cross-platform Python library for [differentiable
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_programming) of quantum computers.

Explore these materials on our website: https://pennylane.ai/qml. All tutorials are fully executable,
and can be downloaded as Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts.

## Contributing 

You can contribute by submitting a demo via a pull request implementing a recent
quantum computing paper/result.

### Adding demos

- Demos are written in the form of an executable Python script.
  Any package listed in `requirements.txt` and `requirements_no_deps.txt` you can assume is
  available to be imported.
  Matplotlib plots will be automatically rendered and displayed on the QML website.

  _Note: try and keep execution time of your script to within 10 minutes_.

- If you would like to write the demo using a Jupyter notebook, you can convert
  the notebook to the required executable Python format by following
  [these steps](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/qml/tree/master/notebook_converter).

- All demos should have a file name beginning with `tutorial_`.
  The python files are saved in the `demonstrations` directory.

- [Restructured Text](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html)
  sections may be anywhere within the script by beginning the comment with
  79 hashes (`#`). These are useful for breaking up large code-blocks.

- You may add figures within ReST comments by using the following syntax:

  ```python
  ##############################################################################
  #.. figure:: ../demonstrations/<demo name>/image.png
  #    :align: center
  #    :width: 90%
  ```

  where `<demo name>` is a sub-directory with the name of
  your demo.

- Add and select an author photo from the `_static/authors` folder. The image name should be as `<author name>_<author surname>.<format>`. If this is a new author and their image is not a headshot, store the original image as `<author name>_<author surname>_original.<format>` and create a cropped headshot with the aforementioned name.
- In the same folder create a `<author name>.txt` file where to include the bio following this structure:

  ```txt
  .. bio:: <author name>
   :photo: ../_static/authors/<author name>_<author surname>.<format>

   <author's bio>
  ```
  
- To show the bio you must add this at the end of the demo:

  ```python
  ##############################################################################
  # About the author
  # ----------------
  # .. include:: ../_static/authors/<author name>.txt  
  ```

- When complete, create a gallery link to your demo. This can be done by adding the
  snippet below to `demos_getting-started.rst` for introductory demos.

  ```rest
  .. gallery-item::
      :tooltip: An extended description of the demo
      :figure: demonstrations/<demo name>/thumbnail.png
      :description: :doc:`demos/tutorial_name`
  ```
  Note that here you will include the thumbnail that will appear in your demo. This image will be created by our team but for convenience in the review, add a provisional image. 
  You should also add there a link to your demo to the table of contents, by adding to the
  end of the `.. toctree::` in the appropriate file.

```rest
.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2
    :caption: Getting Started
    :hidden:

    demos/tutorial_qubit_rotation
    demos/tutorial_name
  ```

  If you're unsure which file to put your demo in, choose the one you think is best,
  and we will work together to sort it during the review process.

- Run your script through the [Black Python formatter](https://github.com/psf/black),

  ```bash
  pip install black
  black -l 100 demo_new.py
  ```
- Finally, add the metadata. The metadata is a `json` file in which we will store information about the demo.
  In [this example](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/qml/blob/master/demonstrations/tutorial_here_comes_the_sun.metadata.json) you will see the fields you need to fill in.
  - Make sure the file name is `<name of your tutorial>.metadata.json`.
  - The "id" of the author will be the same as the one you chose when creating the bio. 
  - The date of publication and modification. Leave them empty in case you don't know them.
  - Choose the categories your demo fits into: `"Getting Started"`, `"Optimization"`, `"Quantum Machine Learning"`, `"Quantum Chemistry"`, `"Devices and Performance"`, `"Quantum Computing"`, `"Quantum Hardware"` or `"Algorithms"`. Feel free to add more than one.
  - In `previewImages` you should simply modify the final part of the file's name to fit the name of your demo. These two images will be sent to you once the review process begins. 
  - `relatedContent` refers to the demos related to yours. You will have to put the corresponding id and set the `weight` to `1.0`. 
  - If there is any doubt with any field, do not hesitate to post a comment to the reviewer of your demo. 

and you are ready to submit a pull request!

If your demo uses the latest release of PennyLane, simply make your PR against the
`master` branch. If you instead require the cutting-edge development versions of
PennyLane or any relevant plugins, make your PR against the `dev` branch instead.

#### Tutorial guidelines

While you are free to be as creative as you like with your demo,
there are a couple of guidelines to keep in mind.

- Submissions should include your name (and optionally email) at the top
  under the title.

- All contributions must be made under the Apache 2.0 license.

- The title should be clear and concise, and if based on a paper it should be similar to the paper
  that is being implemented.

- All demos should include a summary below the title.
  The summary should be 1-3 sentences that makes clear the
  goal and outcome of the demo, and links to any papers/resources used.

- Code should be clearly commented and explained, either
  as a ReST-formatted comment or a standard Python comment.

- Thumbnails should be legible, interesting, and unique --- but not too busy!
  Any included text should be minimal and legible.

- If your content contains random variables/outputs, a fixed seed should
  be set for reproducibility.

- All content must be original or free to reuse subject to license compatibility.
  For example, if you are implementing someone else's research, reach out first to
  recieve permission to reproduce exact figures. Otherwise, avoid direct screenshots
  from papers, and instead refer to figures in the paper within the text.

- All submissions must pass code review before being merged into the repository.

## Building

To build the website locally, simply run `make html`. The rendered HTML files
will now be available in `_build/html`. Open `_build/html/index.html` to browse
the built site locally.

Note that the above command may take some time, as all demos
will be executed and built! Once built, only _modified_ demos will
be re-executed/re-built.

Alternatively, you may run `make html-norun` to build the website _without_ executing
demos, or build only a single demo using the following command:

```console
sphinx-build -D sphinx_gallery_conf.filename_pattern=tutorial_QGAN\.py -b html . _build
```

where `tutorial_QGAN` should be replaced with the name of the demo to build.

## Building and running locally on Mac (M1)

To install dependencies on an M1 Mac and build the QML website, the following instructions may be useful.

- If python3 is not currently installed, we recommend you install via [Homebrew](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge):

  ```bash
  brew install python
  ```

- Install each package in `requirements-norun.txt` by running

  ```bash
  pip3 install -r requirements-norun.txt
  ```

  Alternatively, you can do this in a new virtual environment using

  ```bash
  python -m venv [venv_name]
  cd [venv_name] && source bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements-norun.txt
  ```

Once this is complete, you should be able to build the website using `make html-norun`. If this succeeds, the `build` folder should be populated with files. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the built site.

If you are running into the error message

```
command not found: sphinx-build
```

you may need to make the following change:

- In the `Makefile` change `SPHINXBUILD = sphinx-build` to `SPHINXBUILD = python3 -m sphinx.cmd.build`.

If you are running into the error message

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'the-module-name'
```

you may need to install the module manually:

```
pip3 install the-module-name
```

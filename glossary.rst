.. glossary::

    :doc:`Automatic Differentiation </glossary/automatic_differentiation>`
        Automatically computing derivatives of the steps of computer programs.

    :doc:`Circuit Ansatz </glossary/circuit_ansatz>`
        An ansatz is a basic architecture of a circuit, i.e., a set of gates that act on
        specific subsystems. The architecture defines which algorithms a variational circuit can implement by
        fixing the trainable parameters. A circuit ansatz is analogous to the architecture of a neural network.

    :doc:`Hybrid Computation </glossary/hybrid_computation>`
        A computation that includes classical *and* quantum subroutines, executed on different devices.

    :doc:`Parameter-shift Rule </glossary/parameter_shift>`
        The parameter-shift rule is a recipe for how to estimate gradients of quantum circuits.
        See also :doc:`quantum gradient </glossary/quantum_gradient>`.

    Quantum Differentiable Programming
        The paradigm of making quantum algorithms differentiable, and thereby trainable. See also
        :doc:`quantum gradient </glossary/quantum_gradient>`.

    :doc:`Quantum Embedding </glossary/quantum_embedding>`
        Representation of classical data as a quantum state.

    Quantum Feature Map
        The mathematical map that embeds classical data into a quantum state. Usually executed by a variational
        quantum circuit whose parameters depend on the input data. See also
        :doc:`Quantum Embedding </glossary/quantum_embedding>`.

    :doc:`Quantum Gradient </glossary/quantum_gradient>`
        The derivative of a quantum computation with respect to the parameters of a circuit.

    :doc:`Quantum Neural Network </glossary/quantum_neural_network>`
        A term with many different meanings, usually refering to a generalization of artificial neural 
        networks to quantum information processing. Also increasingly used to refer to :doc:`variational circuits </glossary/variational_circuit>` in the context of quantum machine learning.
        
    Quantum Node
        A quantum computation executed as part of a larger :doc:`hybrid computation </glossary/hybrid_computation>`.

    :doc:`Variational Circuit </glossary/variational_circuit>`
        Variational circuits are quantum algorithms that depend on tunable parameters, and can therefore
        be optimized.

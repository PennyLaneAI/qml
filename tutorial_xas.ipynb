    "X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a technique for understanding unwanted structures in battery materials. This demo will show you how to implement an algorithm developed in the paper \"Fast simulations of X-ray absorption spectroscopy for battery materials on a quantum computer\" [Fomichev:2025].  XAS was identified as a potential application for early fault-tolerant quantum computers. X-rays are high energy, and so are short wavelength. Therefore, they probe a very localized grouping of atoms in a materials. We only need to simulate a small number of molecular orbitals to estimate the energy of the orbitals, and the ones accessible by X-rays. However, there is a large amount of correlations between these molecular states. This is the sweet spot between not having to require too many qubits, but having enough correlations that make the calculation intractible on a quantum computer. The ground state is computable, but the highly correlated high-energy states are very difficult to compute in a quantum chemistry classical computation"

    "In this demo we will implement a simplified version of the algorithm as it appears in the paper -- we will not be applying all of the optimizations present. We will show how to determine and prepare a group state, how determine the states that result from acting on the group state by the dipole operator (representing the electromagnetic field from the X-ray) and how to code the time-domain analysis circuit which can determine the spectrum.\n",

    "We will be using concepts that were introduced in other PennyLane demos, such as utilizing pyscf with PennyLane, initial state preparation of molecules, and building compressed double-factorized Hamiltonians. If you haven't checked out those demos yet, it might be best to do so and then come back here."

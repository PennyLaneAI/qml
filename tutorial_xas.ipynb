    "X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a technique for understanding unwanted structures in battery materials. This demo will show you how to implement an algorithm developed in the paper \"Fast simulations of X-ray absorption spectroscopy for battery materials on a quantum computer\" [Fomichev:2025].  XAS was identified as a potential application for early fault-tolerant quantum computers. X-rays are high energy, and so are short wavelength. Therefore, they probe a very localized grouping of atoms in a materials. We only need to simulate a small number of molecular orbitals to estimate the energy of the orbitals, and the ones accessible by X-rays. However, there is a large amount of correlations between these molecular states. This is the sweet spot between not having to require too many qubits, but having enough correlations that make the calculation intractible on a quantum computer. The ground state is computable, but the highly correlated high-energy states are very difficult to compute in a quantum chemistry classical computation"

Typically the frequency range is focused on a target atom in a molecular cluster, and also near a transition energy, such as targetting core $1s$ electrons.

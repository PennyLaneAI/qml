    "X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a technique for understanding unwanted structures in battery materials. This demo will show you how to implement an algorithm developed in the paper \"Fast simulations of X-ray absorption spectroscopy for battery materials on a quantum computer\" [Fomichev:2025].  XAS was identified as a potential application for early fault-tolerant quantum computers. X-rays are high energy, and so are short wavelength. Therefore, they probe a very localized grouping of atoms in a materials. We only need to simulate a small number of molecular orbitals to estimate the energy of the orbitals, and the ones accessible by X-rays. However, there is a large amount of correlations between these molecular states. This is the sweet spot between not having to require too many qubits, but having enough correlations that make the calculation intractible on a quantum computer. The ground state is computable, but the highly correlated high-energy states are very difficult to compute in a quantum chemistry classical computation"

    "In this tutorial, we have implemented a simplified version of the algorithm as presented in [Fomichev:2025]. The algorithm represents a culmination of many optimizations for time-evolving an eletronic Hamiltonian. We've also discussed how XAS is a promising candidate for early fault-tolerant quantum computers due to its low qubit overhead but high amount of correlations in the state space. "

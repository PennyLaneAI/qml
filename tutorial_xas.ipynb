    "X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a technique for understanding unwanted structures in battery materials. This demo will show you how to implement an algorithm developed in the paper \"Fast simulations of X-ray absorption spectroscopy for battery materials on a quantum computer\" [Fomichev:2025].  XAS was identified as a potential application for early fault-tolerant quantum computers. X-rays are high energy, and so are short wavelength. Therefore, they probe a very localized grouping of atoms in a materials. We only need to simulate a small number of molecular orbitals to estimate the energy of the orbitals, and the ones accessible by X-rays. However, there is a large amount of correlations between these molecular states. This is the sweet spot between not having to require too many qubits, but having enough correlations that make the calculation intractible on a quantum computer. The ground state is computable, but the highly correlated high-energy states are very difficult to compute in a quantum chemistry classical computation"

We will show how to determine and prepare a group state, how determine the states that result from acting on the group state by the dipole operator (representing the electromagnetic field from the X-ray) and how to code the time-domain analysis circuit which can determine the spectrum.\n",

    "We can restrict the range of frequencies, and consequently the range of final states, by only considering final states for which *core* electrons are excited, i.e. there exists a hole in the core orbitals. These are known as core-excited states, and lie significally above the valance-excited states in energy. Typically the frequency range is focused on a target atom in a molecular cluster, and also near a transition energy, such as targetting core $1s$ electrons. We will also neglect relativistic corrections, and focus on frequencies for which the dipole approximation is valid, which is the assumption that the wavelength of the radiation is large compared to the extent of the electronic wavefunction.\n",

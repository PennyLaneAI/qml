What is Quantum Machine Learning?
=================================

The limits of what machines can learn have always been defined by the computer hardware
we run our algorithms on - for example, the success of modern-day deep learning  with neural networks is
enabled by parallel GPU clusters.

Quantum machine learning extends the pool of hardware for machine learning by an entirely
new type of computing device - the quantum computer. Information processing with quantum computers
underlies substantially different laws of physics, namely quantum theory.

While a lot of research focuses on ideal, universal quantum processing units (QPUs) whose development
is still a thing of the future [REFs], a large share of quantum machine learning - and the share
PennyLane caters for - is interested in near term quantum devices [REFs]. One can understand these devices
as special purpose hardware in between Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).

The quantum device is used as a neural network: Data gets "loaded" into the quantum state of the
hardware and then processed. A measurement reveals the outcome of the machine learning model, for example,
if an image showed a cat or a dog. The crucial point is that near-term quantum computers are just physical
machines that are programmed by control parameters, such as an electromagnetic field. By systematically
adapting these parameters, the quantum computation - and hence the machine learning algorithm - becomes
*trainable*.

But the story does not end here. Quantum circuits turn out to be *differentiable*, which means that a quantum computer
can compute the change in control parameters needed to become better at a given task. Differentiable programming
is the very basis of deep learning, implemented in software libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
Differentiable programming is also more than deep learning, it is a programming paradigm where steps of an
algorithm are not hand-coded but learnt for a given task.

Similarly, the idea of trainable quantum computations is larger than quantum machine learning. It includes,
and in fact originates, from a field called *quantum chemistry* [REF], in which adaptable quantum circuits are
used to find ground state energies of atoms and molecules. Trainable circuits also feature
in *quantum optimization* [REF], where optimization problems are solved using quantum computers. It can be used
to design quantum algorithms [REF] and correct errors [REF].

PennyLane is a software framework that is built around the concept of trainable quantum circuits or
*differentiable quantum computation*, to fully exploit the power quantum machine learning and beyond.

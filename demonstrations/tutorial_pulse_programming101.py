Author: Korbinian Kottmann — Posted: 8 March 2023.

Quantum computers perform gates via electromagnetic pulses on the hardware level. In differentiable pulse programming, we
can write quantum algorithms directly on the hardware level and variationally optimize the shape, phase and amplitude of the interactions
for our desired goals.
In this demo, we are going to introduce pulse programming with qubits in PennyLane and run the
ctrl-VQE algorithm [#Mitei]_ on a two-qubit Hamiltonian for the :math:`\text{HeH}^+` molecule.

Pulses in quantum computers
---------------------------

In many quantum computing architectures such as `superconducting <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_sc_qubits.html>`_, `ion trap <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_trapped_ions.html>`_ 
and `neutral atom Rydberg <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_pasqal.html>`_ systems,
qubits are realized through physical systems with a discrete set of energy levels.
For example, transmon qubits realize an anharmonic oscillator whose ground and first excited states can serve as the two energy
levels of a qubit. Such a qubit can be controlled via an electromagnetic field tuned to its energy gap. In general, this
electromagnetic field can be altered in time, leading to a time-dependent Hamiltonian :math:`H(t)` describing the effect of the field on the qubits.
We call driving the system with such an electromagnetic field for a fixed time window :math:`[t_0, t_1]` a *pulse sequence*. 
During a pulse sequence, the state evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation

.. math:: \frac{d}{dt}|\psi\rangle = -i H(t) |\psi\rangle

from an initial state :math:`|\psi(t_0)\rangle` to a final state :math:`|\psi(t_1)\rangle`. This process corresponds to a unitary evolution :math:`U(t_0, t_1)`
of the input state from time :math:`t_0` to :math:`t_1`, i.e. :math:`|\psi(t_1)\rangle = U(t_0, t_1) |\psi(t_0)\rangle`.

In most digital quantum computers (with the exception of `measurement-based <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_mbqc.html>`_ architectures), the amplitude and frequencies of predefined pulse sequences are
fine tuned to realize the native gates of the quantum computer. More specifically, the Hamiltonian interaction :math:`H(t)`
is tuned such that the respective evolution :math:`U(t_0, t_1)` realizes for example a Pauli or CNOT gate (see e.g. *cross-resonance* gates for superconducting qubits in [#Sheldon2016]_).

Pulse programming in PennyLane
------------------------------

A user of a quantum computer typically operates on the higher and more abstract gate level.
Future fault-tolerant quantum computers require this abstraction to allow for error correction.
For noisy and intermediate-sized quantum computers, the abstraction of decomposing quantum algorithms
into a fixed native gate set can be a hindrance and unnecessarily increase execution time, therefore leading
to more noise in the computation. The idea of differentiable pulse programming is to optimize quantum circuits on the pulse
level instead, with the aim of achieving the shortest interaction sequence a hardware system allows.

In PennyLane, we can simulate arbitrary qubit system interactions to explore the possibilities of such pulse programs.
First, we need to define the time-dependent Hamiltonian :math:`H(p, t)= \sum_i f_i(p_i, t) H_i` with constant operators :math:`H_i` and control fields :math:`f_i(p_i, t)`.
The Hamiltonian depends on the set of parameters :math:`p = \{p_i\}`. One way to do this in PennyLane is in the following way:
"""

import pennylane as qml

jax.config.update("jax_enable_x64", True)

def f1(p, t):
    # polyval(p, t) evaluates a polynomial of degree N=len(p)
    # i.e. p[0]*t**(N-1) + p[1]*t**(N-2) + ... + p[N-2]*t + p[N-1]
    return jnp.polyval(p, t)

def f2(p, t):
    return p[0] * jnp.sin(p[1] * t)

Ht = f1 * qml.PauliX(0) + f2 * qml.PauliY(1)

##############################################################################
# This constructs a :class:`~pennylane.pulse.ParametrizedHamiltonian`. Note that the ``callable`` functions ``f1`` and ``f2``
# are expected to have the fixed signature ``(p, t)``. When calling the :class:`~pennylane.pulse.ParametrizedHamiltonian`, 
# a ``tuple`` or ``list`` of the parameters for each of the functions is passed in the same
# order the Hamiltonian was constructed.

p1 = jnp.ones(5)              # parameters for f1
p2 = jnp.array([1.0, jnp.pi]) # parameters for f2

##############################################################################
# We can construct general Hamiltonians of the form :math:`\sum_i H_i^d + \sum_i f_i(p_i, t) H_i`
# using :func:`qml.dot <pennylane.dot>`. Such a time-dependent Hamiltonian consists of time-independent drift terms :math:`H_i^d`
# and time-dependent control terms :math:`f_i(p_i, t) H_i` with scalar complex-valued functions :math:`f_i(p, t).` 
# In the following we are going to construct :math:`\sum_i X_i X_{i+1} + \sum_i f_i(p_i, t) Z_i` with :math:`f_i(p_i, t) = \sin(p_i^0 t) + \sin(p_i^1 t) \forall i` as an example:

coeffs = [1.0] * 2
coeffs += [lambda p, t: jnp.sin(p[0] * t) + jnp.sin(p[1] * t) for _ in range(3)]
ops = [qml.PauliX(i) @ qml.PauliX(i + 1) for i in range(2)]
ops += [qml.PauliZ(i) for i in range(3)]

# random coefficients
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(777)
subkeys = jax.random.split(key, 3) # create list of 3 subkeys
params = [jax.random.uniform(subkeys[i], shape=[2], maxval=5) for i in range(3)]
print(Ht(params, 0.5))

##############################################################################
# We can visualize the Hamiltonian interaction by plotting the time-dependent envelopes. We refer to the drift term as all constant terms in time, i.e. :math:`\sum_i X_i X_{i+1}`,
# and plot the envelopes :math:`f_i(p_i, t)` of the time-dependent terms :math:`f_i(p_i, t) Z_i`.

ts = jnp.linspace(0.0, 5.0, 100)
fs = Ht.coeffs_parametrized

#
# A pulse program is then executed by using the :func:`~.pennylane.evolve` transform to create the evolution
# gate :math:`U(t_0, t_1)`, which implicitly depends on the parameters ``p``. The objective of the program
# is then to compute the expectation value of some objective Hamiltonian ``H_obj`` (here :math:`\sum_i Z_i` as a simple example).

# We used the decorator ``jax.jit`` to compile this execution just-in-time. This means the first execution will typically take a little longer with the
# benefit that all following executions will be significantly faster, see the `jax docs on jitting <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/02-jitting.html>`_.
# Note that when removing the ``jax.jit`` decorator, the numerical solver `odeint <https://github.com/google/jax/blob/main/jax/experimental/ode.py>`_ for the time evolution
# inside :func:`~.pennylane.evolve` is still jit-compiled by default.

# Researchers interested in more specific hardware systems can simulate them using the specific Hamiltonian interactions.
# For example, we will simulate a transmon qubit system in the ctrl-VQE example in the last section of this demo.
#
# Gradients of pulse programs
# ---------------------------
# Internally, pulse programs in PennyLane solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation using the `Dopri5 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormand%E2%80%93Prince_method>`_ solver for
# ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In particular, the step sizes between :math:`t_0` and :math:`t_1` are chosen adaptively to stay within a given error tolerance.
# We can backpropagate through this ODE solver and obtain the gradient via ``jax.grad``.

print(jax.grad(qnode)(params))

##############################################################################
# Alternatively, one could consider computing the gradient with the parameter shift rule [#Leng2022]_, which is particularly interesting for
# real hardware execution. In classical simulations, however, backpropagation is recommended.


##############################################################################
# Piecewise-constant parametrizations
# ------------------------------------
# PennyLane also provides a variety of convenience functions to create, for example, piece-wise-constant parametrizations
# defining the function values at fixed time bins as parameters. We can construct such a callable with :func:`~pennylane.pulse.pwc`
# by providing a ``timespan`` argument which is expected to be either a total time (``float``) or a start and end time (``tuple``).

##############################################################################
# This creates a callable with signature ``(p, t)`` that returns ``p[int(len(p)*t/duration)]``, such that the passed parameters are the function values
# for different time bins.
# Note how the number of time bins is implicitly defined through the length of the parameters. In the following example, we are going to use
# ``4`` and ``10`` time bins defined through the length of parameters, respectively. Let us create uniformly random parameters between 0 and 5 and plot
# the corresponding piece-wise-constant function sampled at ``100`` different points in time.

key = jax.random.PRNGKey(777)
subkeys = jax.random.split(key, 2) # creates a list of two sub-keys

# Variational quantum eigensolver with pulse programming

# We are using :math:`\text{HeH}^+` as a simple example and load it from the `PennyLane quantum datasets <https://pennylane.ai/qml/datasets.html>`_ website.

# For this drive, there are certain restrictions by the hardware that we want to already account for to make our simulation as realistic as possible.

#
# Conclusion
# ----------
# Pulse programming is an exciting new field within noisy quantum computing. By skipping the digital abstraction, one can
# write variational programs on the hardware level, potentially minimizing the computation time. Ideally, this allows for effectively deeper
# circuits on noisy hardware.
# On the other hand, the possibility to continuously vary the Hamiltonian interaction in time significantly increases
# the parameter space. A good parametrization trading off flexibility and the number of parameters is therefore necessary as systems scale up.
# Further, the increased flexibility also affects the search space in Hilbert space that pulse gates can reach.
# Barren plateaus in variational quantum algorithms are typically due to a lack of a good inductive bias in the ansatz, i.e. having a search space that is too large.
# It is therefore crucial to find physically motivated ansätze for pulse programs.

# Part 1

Matrix Product State basics
---------------------------

Matrix Product States (MPS) are an efficient representation of low entanglement states.
The amount of entanglement the MPS can represent is user-controlled via a hyper-parameter, the so-called `bond dimension` :math:`\chi`.
If we allow :math:`\chi` to be of :math:`\mathcal{O}(2^{\frac{n}{2}})` for a system of :math:`n` qubits, we can write `any` state as an `exact` MPS.
To avoid exponentially large resources, however, one typically sets a finite bond dimension :math:`\chi` at the cost of introducing an approximation error.
For some specific classes of states, this is provably sufficient to have a faithful representations (see note box below). 
But because MPS come with a lot of powerful computational features that we are going to discuss later (in particular canonical forms),
they are still used in much more complex systems where these requirements do not hold anymore, and still yield good results.
For example, state of the art quantum chemistry simulations were performed using MPS (citation needed).

It is known that there are more suitable tensor network states for more complex situations (see note box below).
However, they all suffer from a significantly larger algorithmic cost as a lot of the things that make MPS so attractive are not true anymore.
To put it plainly, it is often simply much easier to use MPS and throw a large amount of resources into the bond dimension than to develop
more advanced tensor network methods.


While more advanced tensor network methods are developed, optimized and democratized, MPS continue to be the workhorse of
many quantum simulation techniques.


.. note::

    Ground states of local and gapped Hamiltonians are known to satisfy the so-called area law of entanglement.
    This law states that the entanglement entropy of a sub-system grows with its area and not its volume.
    For one dimensional systems, the surface area of a non-disjoint sub-system is just a constant, and the entanglement
    between any such sub-system in an MPS with a finite bond dimension :math:`\chi` is naturally bounded by :math:`\log(\chi)=\text{const.}`,
    so MPS satisfy the area law of entanglement for one-dimensional systems.

    PEPS are the natural generalization to regular 2D or 3D grids as well as more general graph connectivities, and are known to fulfill the
    respective area laws of entanglement, making them the correct ans√§tze for local and gapped Hamiltonians in those cases. For example, for a 2D
    PEPS with a square subsystem of size :math:`L` and bond dimension :math:`\chi`, the entanglement entropy between the that square and the rest of the system is bounded by
    :math:`\log(\chi^L) = L \log(\chi)`, which is proportional to the circumference.



Compression using Singular Value Decomposition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To understand MPS and bond dimension, we first need to understand how one can generally use the singular value decomposition (SVD) to do compression.
Any matrix :math:`M = \mathbb{C}^{M\times N}` can be singular-value-decomposed as

.. math:: M = U \Lambda V^\dagger,

where :math:`\Lambda` is the diagonal matrix of the :math:`r=\min(m, n)` real and non-negative singular values, 
:math:`U \in \mathbb{C}^{m\times r}` is left-unitary :math:`U^\dagger U = \mathbb{I}_r`, and
:math:`V^\dagger \in \mathbb{C}^{r\times n}` is right-unitary :math:`V V^\dagger = \mathbb{I}_r`.
We say the columns and rows of :math:`U` and :math:`V^\dagger` are the left- and right-orthogonal
singular vectors, respectively. In the case of square and normal matrices, the singular values and singular vectors
are just the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Small singular values and their corresponding singular vectors carry little information of the matrix. When the singular values have
a tail of small values, we can compress the matrix by throwing away these numbers, and the corresponding singular vectors.
This is best seen by a small example, let us load the image we have shown in the header of this demo and compress it.

img = plt.imread("../_static/demo_thumbnails/regular_demo_thumbnails/thumbnail_shadow_hamiltonian_simulation.png")

img = img[:, :, 0]

U, Lambda, Vd = np.linalg.svd(img)

chi = 50
U_compressed = U[:, :chi]
Lambda_compressed = Lambda[:chi]
Vd_compressed = Vd[:chi]

compressed_img = U_compressed @ np.diag(Lambda_compressed) @ Vd_compressed

size_original = np.prod(img.shape)

#
# The original image is :math:`334 \times 542` pixels, that we compress in the :math:`334 \times 50`
# :math:`U`, :math:`50` :math:`\Lambda` and :math:`50 \times 542` :math:`V^\dagger`.
# This is possible because the information density in the image is low, as seen by the distribution of singular values


_, Lambda, _ = np.linalg.svd(img) # recompute full spectrum
plt.plot(Lambda)

##############################################################################
# 
# We are later going to do the same trick with state vectors.
# Note that the compressed information is encoded in :math:`U`, :math:`S` and :math:`Vd`.
# If we want to retrieve the actual image :math:`M` (or state vector), we still need to reconstruct the full :math:`334 \times 542` pixels.
# Luckily, as we will later see in the case of MPS, we can retrieve all relevant information efficiently from the compressed components without ever 
# having to reconstruct the full state vector.
#
# Turn any state into an MPS
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# Formally, any quantum state :math:`|\psi\rangle \in \mathbb{C}^{2^n}` on :math:`n` qubits can be written as a Matrix Product State (MPS).
# The goal will be to write an arbitrary state :math:`|\psi\rangle = \sum_{\sigma_1, .., \sigma_n} \psi_{\sigma_1, .., \sigma_n} |\sigma_1 .. \sigma_n\rangle` in the form
#
# ..math:: |\psi\rangle = \sum_{\sigma_1, .., \sigma_n} U^{\sigma_1} .. U^{\sigma_n} |\sigma_1 .. \sigma_n\rangle,
#
# where we decomposed the rank :math:`n` tensor :math:`\psi_{\sigma_1, .., \sigma_n}` into a product of matrices :math:`U^{\sigma_j}`
# for each value of :math:`\sigma_j=0, 1` for qubits. This is why it is called a **matrix product** state, even though most of these object are, technically, rank-3 tensors.
#
# Graphically, this corresponds to splitting up the big rank-n tensor into :math:`n` smaller tensors, 
# similar to what we did above in the example of compressing an image.

#
# To make things simpler, let us look at concrete state vector with :math:`n=3` sites, so :math:`\psi_{\sigma_1 \sigma_2 \sigma_3}`.

n = 3 # three sites = three legs
psi = np.random.rand(2**3)
psi = psi / np.linalg.norm(psi)  # random, normalized state vector
psi = np.reshape(psi, (2, 2, 2)) # rewrite psi as rank-n tensor

##############################################################################
#
#
# We rewrite the tensor as a matrix with indices of the first site :math:`\sigma_1` and the combined indices of all remaining sites, :math:`(\sigma_2 \sigma_3)`
# Now that we have a matrix, we can perform SVD to split off the first site. Mathematically, this is
#
# .. math:: \psi_{\sigma_1 \sigma_2 \sigma_3} = \psi_{\sigma_1, (\sigma_2 \sigma_3)} = \sum_{\mu_1} U_{\sigma_1 \mu_1} \Lambda_{\mu_1} V^\dagger_{\mu_1 (\sigma_2 \sigma_3)}.
#

# reshape vector to matrix
psi = np.reshape(psi, (2, 2**(n-1)))
# SVD to split off first site
U, Lambda, Vd = np.linalg.svd(psi, full_matrices=False)

##############################################################################
#
# For convenience, we separate so-called physical indices :math:`\sigma_j` as superscripts, and so-called virtual indices :math:`\mu_1` as subscripts.
# We also multiply the singular values onto :math:`V^\dagger` and call this the remainder state :math:`\psi'_{\mu_1, (\sigma_2 \sigma_3)}`,
# so overall we have
# 
# .. math:: \psi_{\sigma_1 \sigma_2 \sigma_3} = \sum_{\mu_1} U^{\sigma_1}_{\mu_1} \psi'_{\mu_1, (\sigma_2 \sigma_3)}.

#
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/mps/psi_to_mps_1.png
#     :align: center
#     :width: 70%
#
# We keep the :math:`U` tensors. We want to maintain the convention that they are of shape ``(virtual_left, physical, virtual_right)``.
# Because there is not virtual index on the left for the first site, we introduce a dummy index.

U = np.reshape(U, (1, 2, 2)) # mu1, s2, mu2

##############################################################################
#
# This procedure is repeated through all sites. The first step was special in that :math:`U^{\sigma_1}_{\mu_1}` is a vector for each value of :math:`\sigma_1`.
# When splitting up :math:`\psi'_{\mu_1, (\sigma_2 \sigma_3)}` we combine the virtual bond with the current site, and have all remaining sites be the other leg of the matrix we create for SVD.
# In particular, we do
# 
# .. math:: \psi'_{\mu_1, (\sigma_2 \sigma_3)} = \psi'_{(\mu_1 \sigma_2), (\sigma_3)} = \sum_{\mu_2} U^{\sigma_2}_{\mu_1 \mu_2} \Lambda_{\mu_2} V^\dagger^{\sigma_3}_{\mu_2}

U, Lambda, Vd = np.linalg.svd(psi_remainder, full_matrices=False)

U = np.reshape(U, (2, 2, 2)) # mu1, s2, mu2
Us.append(U)

U.shape, Lambda.shape, Vd.shape

##############################################################################
# We again multiply the singular values onto the new :math:`V^\dagger` and take that as the remainder state :math:`\psi''`.
# The state overall now reads
#
# .. math:: \psi_{\sigma_1 \sigma_2 \sigma_3} = \sum_{\mu_1 \mu_2} U^{\sigma_1}_{\mu_1} U^{\sigma_2}_{\mu_1 \mu_2} \psi''^{\sigma_3}_{\mu_2}.
#
# When the state is normalized, we are done. Else, we can do the procedure one more time again with a virtual dummy dimension on the right-most site.

psi_remainder = np.diag(Lambda) @ Vd                 # mu1 (s2 s3)
psi_remainder = np.reshape(psi_remainder, (2*2, 1))  # (mu1 s2), s3

##############################################################################
# Because our state vector was already normalized, the singular value in this last SVD is just ``1.``. Else it would yield the norm of ``psi``
# (a good exercise to confirm by skipping the normalization step in the definition of ``psi`` above).
#
# The collected tensors :math:`U^{\sigma_i}_{\mu_{i-1}, \mu_i}` now make up the matrix product state and describe the original state :math:`|\psi\rangle`
# by appropriately contracting the virtual indices :math:`\mu_i`. We can briefly confirm this by reverse engineering the original state. Due to the convention of
# the indices as ``(virtual_left, physical, virtual_right)``, the contraction is simple and we can use the standard 
# `np.tensordot <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.tensordot.html>`_ with ``axes=1`` indicating matrix-product-like contraction of the left-most and right-most index.
# This is one way of thinking of the obtained state as a **matrix product** state.

print(f"Shapes of Us: {[_.shape for _ in Us]}")

for i in range(1, len(Us)):
    psi_reconstruct = np.tensordot(psi_reconstruct, Us[i], axes=1) # contract the rightmost with the left most index

# Up to this point, the description of the original state in terms of the MPS, made up by the three matrices :math:`U^{\sigma_i}_{\mu_{i-1}, \mu_i}`, is exact.
# With this construction, the sizes of the virtual bonds grow exponentially from :math:`2` to :math:`2^{n/2}` until the middle of the chain.
#
# Just like in the example with images before, we can compress the state by only keeping 
# the :math:`\chi` largest singular values, and respective singular vectors.
# The hyper-parameter :math:`\chi` is called the bond dimension and it allows us 
# to control the amount of entanglement the state can represent between everything that 
# is left and right of the bond (more on that later).
#
# A full subroutine from :math:`|\psi\rangle` to its compressed MPS description is given by the following function ``dense_to_mps``.
# It is convenient to also keep the singular values for each bond, we will shortly see why.

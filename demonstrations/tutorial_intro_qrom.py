r"""Intro to quantum read-only memory (QROM)
=============================================================

Managing data is a crucial task, and quantum computers are no exception: efficient data management is vital in `quantum machine learning <https://pennylane.ai/qml/quantum-machine-learning/>`__, search algorithms, and :doc:`state preparation </demos/tutorial_initial_state_preparation/>`.
In this demonstration, we will discuss the concept of a quantum read-only memory (QROM), a data structure designed to load classical data into a quantum computer.
This is a valuable tool in quantum machine learning or for preparing quantum states among others.
We also explain how to use this operator in PennyLane using the :class:`~.pennylane.QROM` template.

QROM
-----

Quantum read-only memory (QROM) is an operator that allows us to load classical data into a quantum computer. Data are represented as a collection of bitstrings (lists composed of 0s and 1s) that we denote by :math:`b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_{N-1}`. The QROM operator is then defined as:

.. math::

    \text{QROM}|i\rangle|0^{\otimes m}\rangle = |i\rangle|b_i\rangle,

where :math:`|b_i\rangle` is the bitstring associated with the :math:`i`-th computational basis state, and :math:`m` is the length of the bitstrings. We have assumed all the bitstrings are of equal length.

For example, suppose our data consists of eight bitstrings, each with two bits: :math:`[01, 11, 11, 00, 01, 11, 11, 00]`. Then, the index register will consist of three
qubits (:math:`3 = \log_2 8`) and the target register of two qubits (:math:`m = 2`). For instance, for the
first four indices, the QROM operator acts as:

.. math::
     \begin{align}
     \text{QROM}|000\rangle|00\rangle &= |000\rangle|01\rangle \\
     \text{QROM}|001\rangle|00\rangle &= |001\rangle|11\rangle \\
     \text{QROM}|010\rangle|00\rangle &= |010\rangle|11\rangle \\
     \text{QROM}|011\rangle|00\rangle &= |011\rangle|00\rangle.
     \end{align}

We will now explain three different implementations of QROM: *Select*, *SelectSwap*, and an extension of *SelectSwap*.

Select
~~~~~~~

:class:`~.pennylane.Select` is an operator that prepares quantum states associated with indices. It is defined as:

.. math::

    \text{Select}|i\rangle|0\rangle = |i\rangle U_i|0\rangle =|i\rangle|\phi_i\rangle,

where :math:`|\phi_i\rangle` is the :math:`i`-th state we want to encode, generated by a known unitary :math:`U_i`.
QROM can be considered a special case of the *Select* operator where the encoded states are computational basis states.
Then the unitaries :math:`U_i` can be simply products of :math:`X` gates satisfying:

.. math::

    U_i|0\rangle =|b_i\rangle.

We use :class:`~.pennylane.BasisState` as a useful template for implementing the gates :math:`U_i`. Let's see how it could be written in code:

"""

# The :class:`~.pennylane.QROM` template can be used to implement the previous circuit using directly the bitstring
# without having to calculate the :math:`U_i` gates:

# Although this approach works correctly, the number of multicontrol gates is high — gates with a costly decomposition.

# which we describe below.
#
# SelectSwap
# ~~~~~~~~~~
# The goal of the *SelectSwap* construction is to trade depth of the circuit for width. That is, using multiple auxiliary qubits,
# we reduce the circuit depth required to build the QROM. Before we get into how it works, let's show you how easy it is to use:
# we simply add ``work_wires`` to the code we had previously.

# - **Swap block**: Swaps the :math:`r`-th row to the target wires.

# As expected, :math:`|b_5\rangle = |11\rangle` is loaded in the target wires.

for i in range(8):
    print(f"The bitstring stored in index {i} is: {circuit(i)[:2]}")
    print(f"The work wires for that index are in the state: {circuit(i)[2:4]}\n")


##############################################################################
# All the work wires have been reset to the zero state.
#
# To achieve this, we follow the technique shown in [#cleanQROM]_, where the proposed circuit (with :math:`R` rows) is as follows:
#
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/qrom/clean_version_2.jpeg
#    :align: center
#    :width: 90%
#    :target: javascript:void(0)
#
# To see how this circuit works, let's suppose we want to load the bitstring :math:`b_{cr}` in the target wires, where :math:`b_{cr}`
# is the bitstring whose operator :math:`U` is placed in the :math:`c`-th column and :math:`r`-th row in the two-dimensional representation shown in the *Select* block.
# We can summarize the idea in a few simple steps.
#
# 0. **Initialize the state.** We create the state:
#
# .. math::
#       |c\rangle |r\rangle |0\rangle |0\rangle \dots |0\rangle.
#
# 1. **A uniform superposition is created in the :math:`r`-th register of the work wires**. To do this, we put the Hadamards in the target wires and move it to the :math:`r`-th row with the *Swap* block:
#
# .. math::
#       |c\rangle |r\rangle |0\rangle |0\rangle \dots |+\rangle_r \dots |0\rangle.
#
# 2. **The Select block is applied.** This loads the whole :math:`c`-th column in the registers. Note that in the :math:`r`-th position, the *Select* has no effect since the state :math:`|+\rangle` is not modified by :math:`X` gates:
#
# .. math::
#       |c\rangle |r\rangle |b_{c0}\rangle |b_{c1}\rangle \dots |+\rangle_r \dots |b_{c(R-1)}\rangle.
#
#
# 3. **The Hadamard gate is applied to the :math:`r`-th register of the work wires.** This returns that register to the zero state. The two *Swap* blocks and the Hadamard gate applied to the target wires achieve this:
#
# .. math::
#       |c\rangle |r\rangle |b_{c0}\rangle |b_{c1}\rangle \dots |0\rangle_r \dots |b_{c(R-1)}\rangle.
#
# 4. **Select block is applied.** Thanks to this, we clean the used registers. That is because loading the bitstring twice in the same register leaves the state as :math:`|0\rangle` since :math:`X^2 = \mathbb{I}`. On the other hand, the bitstring :math:`|b_{cr}\rangle` is loaded in the :math:`r` register:
#
# .. math::
#       |c\rangle |r\rangle |0\rangle |0\rangle \dots |b_{cr}\rangle_r \dots |0\rangle.
#
# 5. **Swap block is applied.** With this, we move :math:`|b_{cr}\rangle` that is encoded in the r-th row to the target wires:
#
# .. math::
#       |c\rangle |r\rangle |b_{cr}\rangle |0\rangle \dots |0\rangle_r \dots |0\rangle.
#
# The desired bitstring has been encoded in the target wires and the rest of the qubits have been left in the zero state.
#
# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# By implementing various versions of the QROM operator, such as *Select* and *SelectSwap*, we can optimize quantum circuits
# for enhanced performance and scalability. These methods improve the efficiency of
# state preparation [#StatePrep]_ techniques. After all, state preparation is a special case of data encoding, where the data are the coefficients that define the state.
# QROM methods are particularly attractive for large-scale quantum computing due to their superior asymptotic efficiency.
# This makes them an indispensable tool for developing new algorithms.

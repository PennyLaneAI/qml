r"""How to simulate quantum circuits with tensor networks
====================================================================

`Tensor networks <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_tn_circuits/>`__ are a powerful computational tool for simulating quantum circuits.
They provide a way to represent quantum states and operations in a compact form. 
Unlike the state-vector approach, tensor networks are particularly useful for large-scale simulations of quantum circuits.

Here, we demonstrate how to simulate quantum circuits using the ``default.tensor`` device in PennyLane.
The used simulator is based on `quimb <https://quimb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__, a Python library for tensor network manipulations, 
and we refer to the `documentation <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.devices.default_tensor.DefaultTensor.html>`__ for more details.
The ``default.tensor`` device is well-suited for simulations of circuits with tens, hundreds, or even thousands of qubits as long as the degree of entanglement 
within the circuit remains manageable. In general, the effectiveness of this device 
depends on the specific circuit structure and the provided keyword arguments.
Note that other simulators based on the state-vector approach may be more suitable for small circuits 
since the overhead of tensor network contractions can be significant.

The :class:`~pennylane.devices.default_tensor.DefaultTensor` device has just been released and is still under development.
Further improvements, new features, and additional tutorials are expected in future releases.
Check the latest functionality in the `documentation <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/latest/code/api/pennylane.devices.default_tensor.DefaultTensor.html>`__ 
or pick among other `PennyLane devices <https://pennylane.ai/plugins/#built-in-devices>`__ for your project.

# Choosing the method to simulate quantum circuits
# ------------------------------------------------
#
# The ``default.tensor`` device can simulate quantum circuits using two different computational methods.
# The first is the matrix product state (MPS) representation, and the second is the full contraction approach using a tensor network (TN).
# We only need to specify the ``method`` keyword argument when instantiating the device to choose one or the other.
# If not specified, the default method is the MPS.
#
# The MPS method can be seen as a particular case of the TN approach, where the tensor network has a one-dimensional structure.
# It can be beneficial for obtaining approximate results, and the degree of approximation can be controlled
# via the maximum bond dimension at the expense of memory and computational cost. It is particularly useful for simulating circuits with low entanglement.
#
# On the other hand, the TN method always yields an exact result but can demand higher computational and memory costs depending
# on the underlying circuit structure and contraction path.

# Finally, the contraction strategy is set to ``auto-mps``. For an explanation of these parameters, we refer to

# We can now simulate the quantum circuit for different numbers of qubits.
# The execution time will generally increase as the number of qubits grows.
# The first execution is typically slower due to the initial setup and compilation processes of ``quimb``.

# Simulating a quantum circuit with the TN method

# The tensor network (TN) method is a more general approach than the matrix product state (MPS) method.

# it may require a large bond dimension to accurately represent highly entangled states. This can lead to increased computational and memory costs.
#
# For example, the full contraction scheme can be helpful in simulating circuits with a higher degree of entanglement,
# although it can also face significant computational and memory challenges.
#
# In the following example, we consider a simple quantum circuit with a configurable depth.
# As in the previous circuit, the number of gates increases with the number of qubits.

# We can also visualize the tensor network representation of the quantum circuit with the ``draw`` method.
# This method produces a graphical representation of the tensor network using ``quimb``'s plotting functionalities.
# The tensor network method usually generates a more complex tensor network than the MPS method.

# Since we did not specify the number of qubits when instantiating the device,
# the number of tensors in the tensor network is inferred from the last execution of the quantum circuit.
# We can visualize the tensor network for 15 qubits.

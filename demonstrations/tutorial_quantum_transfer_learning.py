    :property="og:description": Combine PyTorch and PennyLane to train a hybrid quantum-classical image
        classifier using transfer learning.
    :property="og:image": https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/transfer_images.png

In this tutorial we apply a machine learning method, known as *transfer learning*, to an
image classifier based on a hybrid classical-quantum network.

This example follows the general structure of the PyTorch
`tutorial on transfer learning <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html>`_
by Sasank Chilamkurthy, with the crucial difference of using a quantum circuit to perform the
final classification task.

More details on this topic can be found in the research paper [1] (`Mari et al. (2019) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08278>`_).


Introduction
------------

Transfer learning is a well-established technique for training artificial neural networks (see e.g., Ref. [2]),
which is based on the general intuition that if a pre-trained network is good at solving a
given problem, then, with just a bit of additional training, it can be used to also solve a different
but related problem.

As discussed in Ref. [1], this idea can be formalized in terms of two abstract networks :math:`A`
and :math:`B`, independently from their quantum or classical physical nature.

As sketched in the above figure, one can give the following **general definition of the
transfer learning method**:

1. Take a network :math:`A` that has been pre-trained on a dataset :math:`D_A` and for a given
   task :math:`T_A`.

2. Remove some of the final layers. In this way, the resulting truncated network :math:`A'`
   can be used as a feature extractor.

3. Connect a new trainable network :math:`B` at the end of the pre-trained network :math:`A'`.

4. Keep the weights of :math:`A'` constant, and train the final block :math:`B` with a
   new dataset :math:`D_B` and/or for a new task of interest :math:`T_B`.

When dealing with hybrid systems, depending on the physical nature (classical or quantum) of the
networks :math:`A` and :math:`B`, one can have different implementations of transfer learning as

summarized in following table:

Classical-to-quantum transfer learning
--------------------------------------

We focus on the CQ transfer learning scheme discussed in the previous section and we give a specific example.

1. As pre-trained network :math:`A` we use **ResNet18**, a deep residual neural network introduced by
   Microsoft in Ref. [3], which is pre-trained on the *ImageNet* dataset.

2. After removing its final layer we obtain :math:`A'`, a pre-processing block which maps any
   input high-resolution image into 512 abstract features.

3. Such features are classified by a 4-qubit "dressed quantum circuit" :math:`B`, i.e., a
   variational quantum circuit sandwiched between two classical layers.

4. The hybrid model is trained, keeping :math:`A'` constant, on the *Hymenoptera* dataset
   (a small subclass of ImageNet) containing images of *ants* and *bees*.

A graphical representation of the full data processing pipeline is given in the figure below.

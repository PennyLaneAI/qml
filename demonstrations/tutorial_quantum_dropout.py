# Are you struggling with overfitting while training Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)?
# 
# In this demo, we show how to exploit the quantum version of the dropout technique to avoid the problem of
# overfitting in overparametrized QNNs. What follows is based on the paper “A General
# Approach to Dropout in Quantum Neural Networks” by F. Scala, et al. [#dropout]_.

#
# What is overfitting and dropout?
# ---------------------------------
#
# Neural Networks (NNs) usually require highly flexible models with lots of trainable parameters in
# order to *learn* a certain underlying function (or data distribution).
# However, being able to learn with low in-sample error is not enough; *generalization* — the ability to provide
# good predictions on previously unseen data — is also desirable.
#
# Highly expressive models may suffer from **overfitting**, which means that
# they are trained too well on the training data, and as a result perform poorly on new, unseen
# data. This happens because the model has learned the noise in the training data, rather than the
# underlying pattern that is generalizable to new data.
#
# **Dropout** is a common technique for classical Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) preventing computational units
# from becoming too specialized and reducing the risk of overfitting [#Hinton2012]_, [#Srivastava2014]_. It consists of randomly removing
# neurons or connections *only during training* to block the flow of information. Once the
# model is trained, the DNN is employed in its original form.
#
# Why dropout for Quantum Neural Networks?
# ----------------------------------------
#
# Recently, it has been shown that the use of overparametrized QNN models
# changes the optimization landscape by removing lots of local minima [#Kiani2020]_, [#Larocca2023]_. On the one hand, this increased number of
# parameters leads to faster and easier training, but on the other hand, it may drive
# the model to overfit the data. This is also strictly related to the `repeated encoding <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_expressivity_fourier_series/>`__ of classical
# data to achieve nonlinearity in the computation. This is why, inspired from classical DNNs, one
# can think of applying some sort of dropout to QNNs. This would correspond to randomly dropping some
# (groups of) parameterized gates during training to achieve better generalization.
#
# Quantum dropout of rotations in a sine regression
# --------------------------------------------------
#
# In this demo we will exploit quantum dropout to avoid overfitting during the regression of noisy
# data originally coming from the *sinusoidal* function. In particular, we will randomly “drop”
# rotations during the training phase. In practice, this will correspond to temporarily setting parameters to a value of 0.
#
# Let’s start by importing Pennylane and ``numpy`` and fixing the random seed for reproducibility:
#

import numpy as np
import pennylane as qml

seed = 12345
np.random.seed(seed=seed)

# The circuit
# ~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Now we define the embedding of classical data and the variational ansatz that will then be combined
# to construct our QNN. Dropout will happen inside the variational ansatz. Obtaining dropout with standard
# Pennylane would be quite straightforward by means of some "if statements", but the training procedure
# will take ages. Here we will leverage JAX in order to speed up the training process with
# Just In Time (JIT) compilation. The drawback is that the definition of the variational ansatz becomes a
# little elaborated, since JAX has its own language for conditional statements. For this purpose we
# define two functions ``true_cond`` and ``false_cond`` to work with ``jax.lax.cond```, which is the JAX
# conditional statement. See this `demo <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_How_to_optimize_QML_model_using_JAX_and_JAXopt/>`__
# for additional insights on how to optimize QNNs with JAX.
#
# Practically speaking, rotation dropout will be performed by passing a list to the ansatz.
# The single qubit rotations are applied depending on the values stored in this list:
# if the value is negative the rotation is dropped (rotation dropout), otherwise it is applied.
# How to produce this list will be explained later in this demo (see the ``make_dropout`` function).

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# dropout rate :math:`p_L` (this will be called ``layer_drop_rate``) and the gate dropout rate :math:`p_G`
# (this will be called ``rot_drop_rate``), the probability :math:`p` that a
# gate is dropped in a layer can be calculated with the conditioned probability law:
#
# .. math::
#
#
#    p=p(A\cap B)=p(A|B)p(B)=p_Gp_L
#
# where :math:`B` represents the selection of a specific layer and
# :math:`A` the selection of a specific gate within the chosen layer.
#
# In the following cell we define a function that produces the list of the indices of rotation gates that
# are kept. For gates which are dropped, the value ``-1`` is assigned to the corresponding index. The structure of the list
# is nested; we have one list per ``inner_layer`` inside one list per each layer, all contained in another list.
# This function will be called at each iteration.

# To test the effectiveness of the dropout technique, we will use a prototypical dataset
# with which it is very easy to overfit: the sinusoidal function. We produce some
# points according to the :math:`\sin` function and then we add some white Gaussian noise
# (noise that follows a normal distribution) :math:`\epsilon`. The noise is essential to obtain overfitting;
# when our model is extremely expressive, it is capable of exactly fit each point and some parameters
# become hyper-specialized in recognizing the noisy features. This makes predictions on new unseen
# data difficult, since the overfitting model did not learn the true underlying data distribution.
# The dropout technique will help in avoiding co-adaptation and hyper-specialization,
# effectively reducing overfitting.

# On the left you can see that without dropout there is a deep minimization of the training loss,
# moderate values of dropout converge, whereas high drop probabilities impede any learning. On
# the right, we can see the difference in generalization during the optimization process. Standard
# training without dropout initially reaches a low value of generalization error, but as the
# model starts to learn the noise in the training data (overfitting), the generalization error grows
# back. Oppositely, moderate values of dropout enable generalization errors comparable to the respective
# training ones. As the learning is not successful for elevated drop probabilities, the generalization
# error is huge. It is interesting to notice that the “not-learning” error is very close to the final
# error of the QNN trained without dropout.
#
# Hence, one can conclude that low values of dropout greatly improve the generalization performance of
# the model and remove overfitting, even if the randomness of the technique inevitably makes the
# training a little noisy. On the other hand, high drop probabilities only hinder the training
# process.
#
# Validation

# To validate the technique we can also check how the model predicts in the whole :math:`[-1,1]` range
# with and without quantum dropout.

# The model without dropout overfits the noisy data by trying to exactly predict each of them,
# whereas dropout actually mitigates overfitting and makes the approximation of the underlying sinusoidal
# function way smoother.
#
# Conclusion
# ----------------------
# In this demo, we explained the basic idea behind quantum dropout and
# how to avoid overfitting by randomly "dropping" some rotation gates
# of a QNN during the training phase. We invite you to check out the paper [#dropout]_
# for more dropout techniques and additional analysis. Try it yourself and develop new
# dropout strategies.

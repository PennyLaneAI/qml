Introduction
------------

Many contemporary quantum computers are operated by steering the qubit state through an
electromagnetic pulse. This can be modeled by means of a time-dependent Hamiltonian 

.. math:: H(\theta, t) = H_\text{drift} + \sum_{j=1}^{N_g} f_j(\theta, t) H_j

with time-dependent, parametrized pulse envelopes :math:`f_j(\theta, t)` and a constant drift term :math:`H_\text{drift}`. A prominent example
is superconducting qubit platforms as described in the :doc:`demo on differentiable pulse programming </demos/tutorial_pulse_programming101>`
or :doc:`the demo about OQC's Lucy </demos/oqc_pulse>`. Such a drive for some time window then induces a unitary evolution :math:`U(\theta)` according
to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.

The parameters :math:`\theta` of :math:`H(\theta, t)` determine the shape and strength of the pulse,
and can be subject to optimization in applications like the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) [#Meitei]_.
Gradient based optimization on hardware is possible by utilizing the stochastic 
parameter-shift (SPS) rule introduced in [#Banchi]_ and [#Leng]_. However, this method is intrinsically stochastic
and may require a large number of shots.

In this demo, we are going to take a look at the recently introduced ODEgen method for computing analytic gradiens 
of pulse gates [#Kottmann]_. It utilizes classical 
ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers for computing gradient recipes of quantum pulse programs
that can be executed on hardware.


ODEgen vs. SPS
--------------

We are interested in cost functions of the form

.. math:: \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \langle 0 | U(\theta)^\dagger H_\text{obj} U(\theta) | 0 \rangle

where we compute the expectation value of some objective Hamiltonian :math:`H_\text{obj}` (think quantum many-body Hamiltonian whose ground state energy we want to estimate).
For simplicity, we assume a sole pulse gate :math:`U(\theta)`. Further, let us assume the so-called pulse generators
:math:`H_q` in :math:`H(\theta, t)` to be Pauli words, which will make SPS rule below a bit more digestible. For more details on the general cases we refer to the original paper [#Kottmann]_.

SPS
~~~

We can compute the gradient of :math:`\mathcal{L}` by means of the stochastic parameter-shift rule via

.. math:: \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \int_0^T d\tau \sum_q \frac{\partial f_q(\theta, \tau)}{\partial \theta_j} \left(\tilde{\mathcal{L}}^+_q(\tau) - \tilde{\mathcal{L}}^-_q(\tau) \right).

The :math:`\tilde{\mathcal{L}}^\pm_q(\tau) = \langle \psi_q^\pm(\tau) | H_\text{obj} | \psi_q^\pm(\tau) \rangle` are the original expectation values with
shifted evolutions :math:`| \psi_q^\pm(\tau) \rangle = U(T, \tau) e^{-i\left(\pm\frac{\pi}{4}\right)H_q} U(\tau, 0)`. Here, we use the notation :math:`U(t_1, t_0)`
to indicate the evolution is going from time :math:`t_0` to :math:`t_1`.
In practice, the integral is approximated via Monte Carlo integration

.. math:: \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} \mathcal{L}(\theta) \approx \frac{1}{N_s} \sum_{\tau \in \mathcal{U}([0, T])} \sum_q \frac{\partial f_q(\theta, \tau)}{\partial \theta_j} \left(\tilde{\mathcal{L}}^+_q(\tau) - \tilde{\mathcal{L}}^-_q(\tau) \right)

where the :math:`\tau \in \mathcal{U}([0, T])` are sampled uniformly between :math:`0` and :math:`T`, and :math:`N_s` is the number 
of Monte Carlo samples for the integration. The larger the number of samples, the better the approximation. 
This comes at the cost of more quantum resources :math:`\mathcal{R}`
in form of the number of distinct expectation values executed on the quantum device,

.. math:: 

    \mathcal{R}_\text{SPS} = 2 N_s N_g.

ODEgen
~~~~~~

In contrast, the recently introduced ODEgen method [#Kottmann]_ has the advantage that it circumvents the need for Monte Carlo sampling by off-loading the complexity
introduced by the time-dynamics to a differentiable ODE solver.

The first step of ODEgen is writing the derivative of a pulse unitary :math:`U(\theta)` as

.. math:: \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} U(\theta) = -i U(\theta) \mathcal{H}_j

with a so-called effective generator :math:`\mathcal{H}_j` for each of the parameters :math:`\theta_j`.
We can obtain :math:`\mathcal{H}_j` classically by computing both :math:`\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} U(\theta)` 
and :math:`U(\theta)` in a forward and backward pass through the ODE solver. We already use such a solver in PennyLane for simulating pulses in :class:`~.pennylane.pulse.ParametrizedEvolution`.
Here, we use it to generate parameter-shift rules that can be executed on hardware.

The next step is to decompose each effective generator into a basis the quantum computer can understand, and, in particular, can execute.
We choose the typical Pauli basis and write

.. math:: \mathcal{H}_j = \sum_\ell \omega_\ell^{(j)} P_\ell

for Pauli words :math:`P_\ell` (e.g. :math:`P_\ell = X_0 Y_1` for some :math:`\ell`). With this decomposition, we can write the gradient of the cost function in terms of parameter-shift rules
that can be executed on a quantum computer:

.. math:: 
    \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta_j} = \langle 0 | \left[U(\theta)^\dagger H_\text{obj} U(\theta), -i\mathcal{H}_j \right] | 0 \rangle \\
    = \sum_\ell 2 \omega_\ell^{(j)} \langle 0 | \left[U(\theta)^\dagger H_\text{obj} U(\theta), -\frac{i}{2} P_\ell \right] |0\rangle \\
    = \sum_\ell 2 \omega_\ell^{(j)} \frac{d}{dx} \left[ \langle 0 | U(\theta)^\dagger e^{i\frac{x}{2} P_\ell} H_\text{obj} e^{-i\frac{x}{2} P_\ell} U(\theta)|0\rangle \right]_{x=0}.

In particular, we can identify

.. math:: L_\ell(x) = \langle 0 | U(\theta)^\dagger e^{i\frac{x}{2} x P_\ell} H_\text{obj} e^{-i\frac{x}{2} P_\ell} U(\theta)|0\rangle

as an expectation value shifted by the dummy variable :math:`x`, whose derivative is given by the standard two-term parameter-shift rule (see e.g. `this derivation <https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/parameter_shift/>`_).
Overall, we have 

.. math:: \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta_j} = \sum_\ell \omega_\ell^{(j)} \left(L_\ell\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) - L_\ell\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}\right) \right).

The quantum resources for ODEgen are :math:`2` executions for each non-zero Pauli term :math:`\omega_\ell^{(j)} P_\ell` (i.e. non-zero for any :math:`j` for a particular :math:`\ell`) of the decomposition.
This number is at most :math:`4^n-1` for :math:`n` qubits. A better upper bound is given by the dimension of the dynamical Lie algebra (DLA) of the pulse Hamiltonian. That is, the number of linearly independent operators
that can be generated from nested commutators of the pulse generators and the drift term. An example would be a pulse Hamiltonian composed of terms :math:`X_0`, :math:`X_1` and :math:`Z_0 Z_1`. A basis for the DLA of
this pulse Hamiltonian is given by :math:`\{X_0, X_1, Z_0Z_1, Y_0Y_1, Y_0Z_0, Z_0Y_0\}`. This tells us that only those terms can be non-zero in a decomposition of any effective generator from gates generated by such a pulse Hamiltonian.

Overall, ODEgen is well-suited for pulse Hamiltonians that act effectively on few qubits - as is the case for superconducting qubit and ion trap qubit architectures - or yield a small DLA.




Numerical experiment
--------------------

We want to put ODEgen and SPS head to head in a variational quantum algorithm with the same available quantum resources.
For this, we are going to perform the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) on the Heisenberg model Hamiltonian

.. math:: H_\text{obj} = X_0 X_1 + Y_0 Y_1 + Z_0 Z_1

for two qubits. The ground state of this Hamiltonian is the maximally entangled singlet state
:math:`|\phi^- \rangle = (|01\rangle - |10\rangle)/\sqrt{2}` with ground state energy :math:`-3`.
Let us define it in PennyLane and also import some libraries that we are going to need for this demo.

# We see that with analytic gradients (ODEgen), we can reach the ground state energy within 100 epochs, whereas with SPS gradients we cannot find the path 
# towards the minimum due to the stochasticity of the gradient estimates. Note that both optimizations start from the same (random) initial point.
# This picture solidifies when repeating this procedure for multiple runs from different random initializations, as was demonstrated in [#Kottmann]_.
#
# We also want to make sure that this is a fair comparison in terms of quantum resources. In the case of ODEgen we maximally have :math:`\mathcal{R}_\text{ODEgen} = 2 (4^n - 1) = 30` expectation values.
# For SPS we have :math:`N_s 4 = 32` (due to :math:`N_s=8` time samples per gradient that we chose in ``num_split_times`` above). Thus, overall, we require fewer 
# quantum resources for ODEgen gradients while achieving better performance.
#
# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# We introduced ODEgen for computing analytic gradients of pulse gates and showcased its advantages in simulation for a VQE example.
# The method is particularly well-suited for quantum computing architectures that build complexity from few-qubit gates, as is the case
# for superconducting qubit architectures.
# We invite you to play with ODEgen yourself. Note that this feature is amenable to hardware and you can compute gradients on OQC's Lucy via PennyLane.
# We show you how to connect to Lucy and run pulse gates in our :doc:`recent demo </demos/oqc_pulse>`.
# Running VQE using ODEgen on hardware has recently been demonstrated in [#Kottmann]_ and you can directly find `the code here <https://github.com/XanaduAI/Analytic_Pulse_Gradients/tree/main/VQE_OQC>`_.

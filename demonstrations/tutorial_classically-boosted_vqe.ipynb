    "One of the most important applications of quantum computers is expected to be the computation of ground-state energies of complicated molecules and materials. Even though there are already some solid proposals on how to tackle these problems when fault-tolerant quantum computation comes into play, we currently live in the [`NISQ`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy_intermediate-scale_quantum_era) era, meaning that we can only access very noisy and limited devices. That is why a large part of the research on quantum algorithms is focusing on what can be done with few resources. In particular, most proposals rely on variational quantum algorithms (VQA), which are optimized classically and adapt to the limitations of the quantum devices. For the specific problem of computing ground-state energies, this reduces to the very well-known Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm.\n",

    "[add picture-drawing VQE vs FT]\n",
    "\n",
    "Although VQE is intended to run on NISQ devices, it is nonetheless sensitive to noise. This is in particular problematic when applying a large number of gates. As a consequence, several modifications to the original VQE algorithm have been proposed. These variants are usually intended to improve the algorithm's performance on NISQ-era devices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will go through one of these proposals step-by-step: the Classically-Boosted Variational Quantum Eigensolver (CB-VQE), which was recently proposed in this [`paper`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04755). Implementing CB-VQE allows to reduce the number of measurements required to obtain the ground-state energy with a certain precision. This is done by making use of classical states which already contain some information about the ground-state of the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we will restrict ourselves to the $H_2$ molecule for the sake of simplicity. First, we will give a short introduction on how to perform standard VQE for the molecule of interest. For more details, we recommend the following [`demo`](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_vqe.html) to learn how to implement VQE for molecules step-by-step. Then, we will implement the CB-VQE algorithm for the specific case in which we rely only on one classical state, that being the Hartree-Fock state. Finally, we will discuss the number of measurements needed to obtain a certain error-threshold by comparing the two methods. \n",

    "One of the most important applications of quantum computers is expected to be the computation of ground-state energies of complicated molecules and materials. Even though there are already some solid proposals on how to tackle these problems when fault-tolerant quantum computation becomes a reality, right now we live in the [`NISQ`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy_intermediate-scale_quantum_era) era, where we can only access very noisy and limited devices. A large part of the research on quantum algorithms is focusing on what can be done for now with few resources. In particular, most of the proposals of the field rely on variational quantum algorithms that adapt to the limitations of the devices.  They can be optimised classically. For the specific problem of computing ground-state energies, this reduces to the very well-known Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm.\n",

    "\n",
    "Although VQE is intended to run on NISQ devices, it is nonetheless sensitive to noise. This is in particular problematic when applying a large number of gates. As a consequence, many different modifications to the original VQE algorithm have been proposed. These modifications are usually intended to improve the algorithm's performance on NISQ-era devices. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we will go through one of these proposals step-by-step: the Classically-Boosted Variational Quantum Eigensolver (CB-VQE), which was recently proposed in this [`paper`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04755). This variant of VQE allows us to reduce the number of measurements required to obtain the ground-state energy with a certain precision by making use of classical states. Classical states already contain some information about the ground-state of the problem. \n",

    "If you are not already familiar with the VQE family of algorithms and wish to see how one can apply it the $H_2$ molecule, feel free to work through [VQE overview demo](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_vqe.html). We will briefly review the main idea behind normal VQE and apply it to the $Li_2$ molecule and use the *6-31G basis* from PennyLane with $M$ active orbitals for $N=6$ electrons. \n",
    "The main goal of VQE is to find the ground energy of the Schr√∂dinger equation $H \\vert \\phi \\rangle = E  \\vert \\phi \\rangle$ which corresponds to finding the smallest eigenvalue. An equivalent formulation is to minimize the energy $E = \\langle \\phi \\vert H \\vert \\phi \\rangle$ which acts as a cost function.\n",

    "For the ansatz $A(\\Theta)$ we choose a circuit comprising of *Givens rotations* $G(\\Theta)$ (TODO::Is nomenclature correct for higher order excatations?) and $X$-operations.

    "A *Givens rotation* gate physically corresponds to the excitation of a certain number of electrons. \n",
    "For now we will focus on single and double excitation gates $G^{(1, 2)}(\\Theta)$ which are conveniently implemented in PennyLane with [`SingleExcitation`](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code/api/pennylane.SingleExcitation.html) and [`DoubleExcitation`](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code/api/pennylane.DoubleExcitation.html) classes. \n",

    "## CLASSICALLY-BOOSTED VQE\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are ready to present the classically-boosted version of VQE. The key of this new method relies on the notion of [`generalized eigenvalue problem`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_eigenvalue_problem). The main idea is to restrict the problem of finding the ground state to an eigenvalue problem on a subspace $\\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}$ of the complete Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$. If this subspace is spanned by a combination of both classical and quantum states, we can run parts of our algorithm on classical hardware and thus reduce the number of measurements needed to reach a certain precision threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first introduce the so-called generalized eigenvalue problem. It is similar to the normal eigenvalue problem with the exception that it may only be defined on some subspace instead the whole vectorspace. We define this subspace as the span of $\\{\\vert \\phi_\\alpha \\rangle\\}_\\alpha$. The generalised eigenvalue problem can be expressed as \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{H} \\vec{v}=  \\lambda \\bar{S} \\vec{v},\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\\bar{H}_{\\alpha, \\beta} = \\langle \\phi_\\alpha \\vert H \\vert \\phi_\\beta \\rangle.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix $\\bar{S}$ contains the overlaps between the basis states. For a complete orthonormal basis, the overlap matrix $\\hat{S}$ would simply be the identity matrix. However, we need to take a more general approach which works for a subspace spanned by potentially non-orthogonal states. Intuitively, we can think of \n",
    "$\\bar{S}=\\sum_{\\alpha}{\\lvert \\phi_{\\alpha}\\rangle \\langle \\phi_{\\alpha}\\rvert}$\n",
    "taking a role similar to that of the identity as $\\bar{S}\\lvert \\phi_{\\alpha} \\rangle = \\lvert \\phi_{\\alpha} \\rangle$ for all $\\alpha$. We can retrieve the representation of $S$ in terms of $\\{\\vert \\phi_\\alpha \\rangle\\}_\\alpha$ by calculating \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $\\vec{v}$ and $\\lambda$ are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues respectively. In particular, our goal is to find the lowest eigenvalue $\\lambda_0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Equipped with the useful mathematical description of generalised eigenvalue problems, we can now choose our subspace such that some of the states $\\phi_{\\alpha} \\in \\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}$ are classically tractable. We define these states to have the property that both $\\bar{S}_{\\alpha, \\beta}$ and $\\bar{H}_{\\alpha, \\beta}$ can be evaluated efficiently on a classical computer [TODO:CITE].\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider the simplest case in which the subspace is spanned only by one classical state $\\vert \\phi_{HF} \\rangle$ and one quantum state $\\vert \\phi_{q} \\rangle$. More precisely, we define the classical state to be a single [`Slater determinant`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slater_determinant), which directly hints towards using the Hartree-Fock state for several reasons. First of all, it is well-known that the Hartree-Fock state is a good candidate to approximate the ground state in the mean-field limit. Secondly, we already compute it when we build the molecular Hamiltonian for the normal VQE!\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, our goal is to build the hamiltonian $\\bar{H}$ and the overlap matrix $\\bar{S}$, which act on the subspace $\\mathcal{H}^{\\prime} \\subseteq \\mathcal{H}$ spanned by $\\{\\vert \\phi_{HF} \\rangle, \\vert \\phi_q \\rangle\\}$. These will be two-dimensional matrices, and in the following Sections we will show how to compute all their entries step by step.\n",

r"""Greetings fellow quantum programmers üëã! Isn‚Äôt it such a wonderful world we live in with so many
different quantum software development kits (SDKs) at our fingertips? I remember the days of (messy)
personalized code bases that took hours and hours to develop just *to be able* to start researching
üë¥. Nowadays, those tools are there for us to access for free, being developed and maintained by
savvy open-source software developers around the clock. Again, what a wonderful world.

When it comes to quantum programming SDKs, PennyLane and
`Qiskit <https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/what-is-qiskit/>`__ are two of the most widely-used by
the community. One of PennyLane‚Äôs beloved staples is that it‚Äôs hardware agnostic; you can program
any piece of hardware all from the easy-to-use PennyLane API. This includes IBM‚Äôs hardware with the
`PennyLane-Qiskit plugin <https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/qiskit/en/latest/>`__, which has been
maintained and developed by us since 2018.

Continuing with those efforts, the PennyLane-Qiskit plugin was upgraded immediately after the first
stable release of Qiskit in February 2024 ‚Äî `Qiskit 1.0 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit>`__ ‚Äî
which shipped with breaking changes from the ``<0.46`` releases. In this demonstration, we want to
show you how we‚Äôve made PennyLane the best its ever been at integrating with Qiskit and interacting
with IBM‚Äôs hardware.

# New to PennyLane? üëÄ
# ====================
# 
# If you‚Äôre already very familiar with PennyLane and its ecosystem, you‚Äôre free to move on to the next
# section. But, if you‚Äôre coming from a Qiskit-heavy background, you will find this section very
# helpful. Here, we‚Äôll go over some basic syntax differences between PennyLane and Qiskit 1.0.
# 
# First, qubits. Qubits in PennyLane are called ‚Äúwires‚Äù. Why? As was mentioned already, PennyLane is
# a hardware agnostic framwork, and ‚Äúwires‚Äù is a more hardware agnostic term for quantum degrees of
# freedom that quantum computers can be based off of. Done! 
# 
# Now let‚Äôs break down what circuits look like in PennyLane compared to Qiskit. For that, let‚Äôs create
# a simple circuit with 2 qubits that prepares the Bell state
# :math:`\vert \Phi^+ \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \vert 00 \rangle + \vert 11 \rangle \right)`.

# The first thing you‚Äôll notice is that PennyLane‚Äôs primitives ‚Äî its foundational building blocks ‚Äî
# are Pythonic and NumPy-like; quantum circuits are functions that return measurements that behave
# like NumPy arrays. The function ``circuit`` is called a *quantum node* (QNode), which is the sum of
# a couple things:
# 
# 1. A *quantum function* that contains quantum instructions. This is ``circuit`` without the
#    ``@qml.qnode(dev)`` decorator; it just contains quantum operations like gates and returns a
#    measurement (in this case, ``qml.counts(wires=1)``, which counts the number of times a ``0`` or a
#    ``1`` occurs and returns a dictionary).
# 2. A device: ``qml.device("default.qubit")``. ``"default.qubit"`` is the name of our battle-tested
#    statevector simulator.
# 
# When you put a quantum function together with a device by decorating ``circuit`` with
# ``@qml.qnode(dev)``, you have a QNode! The QNode can be called like a regular Python function ‚Äî
# simple as that üåà. 
#
# This section is definitely a non-exhaustive look at what PennyLane can do. But, hopefully inspecting
# the differences between Qiskit and PennyLane through this simple example is enough to understand how
# PennyLane roughly works. If you want to learn more about PennyLane, we have an arsenal of amazing
# learning material on our website: https://pennylane.ai/qml/#all-content. If you‚Äôre just starting
# out, I recommend `our introductory
# tutorial <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qubit_rotation/>`__.
# 
# Let‚Äôs get to how you can use the PennyLane-Qiskit plugin.
# 

######################################################################
# The PennyLane-Qiskit plugin üíæ
# ==============================
# 
# .. note::
#    To follow along, we recommend installing the PennyLane-Qiskit plugin by doing
#    ``pip install -U pennylane-qiskit`` in your desired environment. This will install PennyLane, the
#    plugin, and the latest pre-1.0 Qiskit version (``0.46.1`` at the time of writing). Luckily, the
#    plugin is compatible with *both* Qiskit 1.0 and pre-1.0. So, you can ``pip install -U qiskit`` in
#    your environment afterwards to have the plugin running alongside Qiskit 1.0. The plugin knows
#    what to do üß†.
# 
# As was mentioned earlier, the PennyLane-Qiskit plugin allows you to integrate your existing Qiskit
# code and run jobs on IBM devices with PennyLane. This encompasses two real-world scenarios: (1)
# working in PennyLane from the start and executing your work on an IBM device and (2) converting your
# existing Qiskit code to PennyLane and executing that on *any* device, including IBM devices. Let‚Äôs
# talk about both.
# 

######################################################################
# Coding in PennyLane, executing on Qiskit 1.0 devices üì§
# -------------------------------------------------------
# 
# If you want to distill how a PennyLane plugin works down to one thing, it‚Äôs all in the devices! In
# PennyLane, you just create your circuit (a quantum function) and decorate it with
# ``@qml.qnode(dev)``, where ``dev`` is (one of) a plugin‚Äôs device(s). In the PennyLane-Qiskit plugin,
# there are `several Qiskit devices <https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/qiskit/en/stable/#devices>`__
# you can use, but here are the heavy-hitters for Qiskit 1.0:
# 
# -  ``"qiskit.basicsim"``: uses the Qiskit ``BasicSimulator`` backend from the ``basic_provider``
#    module in Qiskit 1.0.
# -  ``"qiskit.ibmq"``: lets you run PennyLane code on IBM Q hardware, where you can choose between
#    different backends - either simulators tailor-made to emulate the real hardware, or the real
#    hardware itself.
# 
# If you want to use any of these devices in PennyLane, just do
# ``dev = qml.device("<device name>", wires=num_qubits)`` and any QNode decorated with
# ``@qml.qnode(dev)`` will execute on the corresponding device or backend. Here‚Äôs a quick example
# showing how simple this is.
# 

import pennylane as qml

dev = qml.device("qiskit.basicsim", wires=2)

@qml.qnode(dev)
def circuit():
    qml.Hadamard(0)
    qml.CNOT([0, 1])
    return qml.expval(qml.Z(0)), qml.expval(qml.X(1))

print(circuit(shots=1000))

######################################################################
# Magic ü™Ñ! With one line of code, you can work inside PennyLane and ship the execution off to your
# favourite IBM device. It‚Äôs exactly like using Qiskit 1.0, but you interact with PennyLane instead.
# 

######################################################################
# Converting Qiskit 1.0 code to PennyLane ü¶ã
# ------------------------------------------
# 
# This is probably what a lot of the audience is wondering: ‚ÄúCan I combine my existing work in Qiskit
# with PennyLane?‚Äù YES. And don‚Äôt worry, you don‚Äôt need to import a ton of things or use a bunch of
# functions ‚Äî you only need to know *two* things:
# 
# 1. ```qml.from_qiskit`` <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.from_qiskit.html>`__:
#    converts an entire Qiskit ``QuantumCircuit`` ‚Äî the whole thing ‚Äî into a PennyLane quantum
#    function. It will faithfully convert Qiskit-side measurements (even mid-circuit measurements) or
#    you can append Pennylane-side measurements directly to it.
# 2. ```qml.from_qiskit_op`` <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.from_qiskit_op.html>`__:
#    converts a ``SparsePauliOp`` in Qiskit 1.0 to the equivalent operator in PennyLane.
# 
# Both of these functions give you all the functionality you need to access PennyLane‚Äôs features and
# user-interface starting from the Qiskit 1.0 side. Let‚Äôs look at an example where both of these
# functions are used.
# 

######################################################################
# Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve created the following Qiskit code that prepares a GHZ state for an arbitrary amount
# of qubits:
# 

from qiskit import QuantumCircuit 

n = 10

def qiskit_GHZ_circuit(n):
    qc = QuantumCircuit(n)
    qc.h(0)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        qc.cx(i, i + 1)
    return qc

######################################################################
# Next, let‚Äôs measure the following ``SparsePauliOp`` operators at the end of the circuit:
# 

from qiskit.quantum_info import SparsePauliOp

operator_strings = ['I' * i + 'XY' + 'I' * (n - 2 - i) for i in range(n-1)]
operators = [SparsePauliOp(operator_string) for operator_string in operator_strings]
operators

######################################################################
# We can convert each ``SparsePauliOp`` into a PennyLane operator with ``qml.from_qiskit_op``:
# 

pl_operators = [qml.from_qiskit_op(qiskit_op) for qiskit_op in operators]
pl_operators

######################################################################
# .. note::
#    What's with the indices starting from the highest and going to the lowest ü§î? PennyLane 
#    orders wires / qubits from *right to left*. This is exactly like the decimal system in that 
#    powers of ten increase from right to left: 
#    :math:`1967 = 1 \times 10^3 + 9 \times 10^2 + 6 \times 10^1 + 7 \times 10^0`. In binary, we 
#    follow the same convention: 
#    :math:`\texttt{int}(1011) = 1 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 1 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 11`. So, 
#    for a list of operator strings like ``'XYIIIIIIII'``, ``X`` is on the tenth qubit (ninth index) 
#    and ``Y`` is on the ninth qubit (eighth index).
# 


######################################################################
# Next, we convert a Qiskit ``QuantumCircuit`` to PennyLane with ``qml.from_qiskit``. We can append
# the measurements ‚Äî expectation values (``qml.expval``) of ``pl_operators`` ‚Äî with the
# ``measurements`` keyword argument, which accepts a list of PennyLane measurements.
# 

measurements = [qml.expval(op) for op in pl_operators]

qc = qiskit_GHZ_circuit(n)
pl_qfunc = qml.from_qiskit(qc, measurements=measurements)

######################################################################
# The last thing to do is make ``pl_func`` a QNode. Another way of turning ``pl_qfunc`` into a QNode 
# is by wrapping it with `qml.QNode` and supplying the device.
# 

pl_circuit = qml.QNode(pl_qfunc, device=qml.device("qiskit.basicsim", wires=n))
pl_circuit()

######################################################################
# And that‚Äôs it! Now you have a copy of your work in PennyLane, where you can access
# fully-differentiable and hardware-agnostic quantum programming. Heck, you could even run your
# Qiskit-to-PennyLane circuit (``pl_qfunc``) on *other* hardware by specifying a different device.
#

Gate calibration with reinforcement learning
============================================

Gate-based quantum circuits are the most common representation of quantum computations. These
provide an abstraction layer that enables the development of quantum algorithms without considering
the hardware in charge of the execution. However, every quantum platform offers a different set of
interactions and controls that define the natural operations that can be performed in the hardware.
These are known as the *native gates* of the device, and they constitute the fundamental
building blocks of any quantum algorithm executed in it. Therefore, it is essential that such
operations are performed as accurately as possible, which requires the careful tuning of the
hardware's controls. In this demo, we will learn how to use reinforcement learning to find the
optimal control parameters to accurately execute quantum gates. We will implement an
experimentally-friendly protocol based on the direct interaction with the hardware, following
the main ideas in [#BaumPRXQ21]_, which we illustrate using superconducting qubits as
an example.

Gate calibration
----------------

Calibrating quantum gates consists in finding the best possible control parameters of the device
that yield the most accurate gate execution. For instance, the gates in superconducting quantum
devices are performed by targeting the qubits with microwave pulses of the form

.. math:: \Omega(t)\sin(\phi(t) + \omega_p t)\,,

\ where :math:`\Omega(t)` is a time-dependent amplitude, :math:`\phi(t)` is a time-dependent phase,
and :math:`\omega_p` is the pulse's frequency. Hence, the proper execution of any gate relies on the
careful selection of these parameters in combination with the pulse duration, which we collectively
refer to as a *pulse program*. However, each qubit in the device has distinct properties, such as
the frequency and the connectivity to other qubits. These differences cause the same pulse programs
to produce different operations for every qubit. Consequently, every gate must be carefully
calibrated for each individual qubit in the hardware. For further details about superconducting
quantum computers and their control see `this demo <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/oqc_pulse/>`__.

A common strategy to calibrate quantum gates involves the detailed modelling of the quantum
computer, enabling the gate optimization through analytical and numerical techniques. Nevertheless,
developing such accurate models requires an exhaustive characterization of the hardware, and it
can be challenging to account for all the relevant interactions in practice.

An alternative promissing approach is through the direct interaction with the device, refraining
from deriving any explicit model of the system. Here, we frame qubit calibration as a reinforcement
learning problem, drawing inspiration from the experimentally-friendly method proposed in reference
[#BaumPRXQ21]_. In this setting, a reinforcement learning agent learns to calibrate the gates by
tuning the control parameters and directly observing the response of the qubits. Through this
process, the agent implicitly learns an effective model of the device, as it faces all the
experimental nuances associated with the process of executing the gates, such as the effect of the
most relevant noise sources. This makes the resulting agent an excellent calibrator that is robust
to these phenomena.

The procedure that we present below is entirely agnostic to the quantum hardware.
Among all the possibilities, we will ilustrate it using coupled-transmon superconducting quantum
computers simulated with PennyLane. This will allow us to focus on the method itself, skipping some
of the nuances associated with the execution on real devices, while ensuring that the resulting
code can be easily adapted to run in a quantum computer using the PennyLane plugins, as shown in
`this demo <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/oqc_pulse/>`__.

Reinforcement learning basics
-----------------------------

In the typical reinforcement learning setting, we find two main entities: an *agent* and an
*environment*. The environment contains the relevant information about the problem and defines the
“rules of the game”. The main goal of the agent is to find the optimal strategy to perform a given
task through the interaction with the environment.

In order to complete the desired task, the agent can observe the environment and perform *actions*,
which can affect the environment and change its *state*. This way, the interaction between them is
cyclic, as depicted in the figure below. Let's take chess as an example. In this case, the agent is
a player and the environment comprises the pieces on the board, the rules, and the opponent. At a
given point in time, the agent observes the environment's state, which can be the current location
of all the pieces on the board. With this information, it can choose to perform a certain action,
such as moving a pawn forward among all its possible moves. Doing so affects the environment, which
provides the agent with the new state it is found in and a *reward*. The new state is the resulting
board configuration after the agent's move and the opponent's response. The reward is a measure of
how well the agent is performing the task given the last interaction. We will see more about the
reward in the following section.

.. figure:: ../demonstrations/rl_pulse/sketch_rl.png
   :align: center
   :width: 75%

The agent chooses its actions according to a *policy*, and **the ultimate goal is to learn the
optimal policy that maximizes the obtained rewards**. In general, the policy can take any form, and
its nature is usually related to the reinforcement learning algorithm that we implement to learn it.
We will see how to learn the optimal policy later. For now, let's see how all these concepts apply
to our task.

Framing qubit calibration as a reinforcement learning problem
-------------------------------------------------------------

Our main objective is to accurately execute a desired quantum gate in our computer's qubits. To do
so, we need a way to find the correct pulse program for each qubit. In reinforcement learning terms,
our agent needs to learn the optimal policy to obtain the pulse program for every qubit.

In this case, the environment is the quantum computer itself, and the states encode information
about the qubit's evolution during the pulse execution. The agent's actions correspond to
adjusting the different “control knobs” we can turn to modulate the microwave pulse. This setting
allows the agent to react to the qubit's peculiarities and adapt the pulse parameters accordingly
to execute the target gate.

The hardest part of this approach is extracting information about the qubit's evolution under
the pulse, since observing it destroys the quantum state. Here, we follow a similar approach to the
one introduced in [#BaumPRXQ21]_. The main idea is to split the pulse program into segments of 
constant properties, commonly known as a piece-wise constant (PWC) pulse, and evaluate the
intermediate states between segments:

1. We fix the total duration and the number of segments of the PWC pulse.
2. We reset the qubit.
3. We perform quantum tomography to determine the qubit's state.
4. With this information, the agent fixes the parameters for the next pulse segment.
5. We reset the qubit and execute the pulse up to the last segment with fixed parameters.
6. We repeat steps 3-5 until we reach the end of the pulse and evaluate the average gate fidelity.


The images below show a schematic representation of the main points in the protocol.
In the first image on the left, the first two pulse segments (blue) are executed as a shorter pulse
than the final result. This is repeated several times to perform quantum state tomography of the
state, whose result is used to determine the parameters of the next pulse segment (yellow).
Afterwards, the system is reset, and the first three segments are executed, which leads to the
second figure on the right. There, the steps are repeated in the same order, evolving the qubit
with the first three segments several times to characterize their effect and determine the
parameters of the fourth pulse segment, reaching the end of the pulse. Given that all the pulse
segments are now fixed, we proceed with the evaluation of the pulse with respect to the target gate
that we wish to execute.

.. figure:: ../demonstrations/rl_pulse/sketch_protocol.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

With this protocol, the agent iteratively builds a PWC pulse that is tailored to the specifics of
the qubit. Even though this protocol involves multiple (partial) executions of the pulse to perform
the intermediate tomography steps, the overall cost remains low provided that it is only for the
qubit(s) involved in the gate, typically one or two.

Building a :math:`R_X(\pi/2)` calibrator
-----------------------------------------

Let's take all these concepts and apply them to train a reinforcement learning agent to calibrate
the single-qubit :math:`R_X(\pi/2)` gate (a.k.a. :math:`\sqrt{X}`), which is a common native gate
in superconducting quantum computers. To do so, we need to define:

- The environment (hardware, actions, and rewards)
- The agent (the policy and how to act)
- The learning algorithm

Then, we'll put all the pieces together and train our agent. Let's introduce these concepts one by
one and implement them from scratch with PennyLane and JAX.

The environment
```````````````

As we mentioned earlier, the environment contains all the information about the problem. In an
experimental setting, the actual quantum computer and how we interact with it would constitute
the environment. In this demo, we will simulate it with PennyLane.

We start by defining the quantum hardware. As we mentioned above, we will simulate a 
superconducting quantum computer. The PennyLane :mod:`~pennylane.pulse` module provides the tools
to simulate quantum systems through time, allowing us to control quantum computers at the lowest
pulse level. To perform the simulation, we will define an effective time-dependent Hamiltonian
for the hardware. We often distinguish between two main components: a constant drift term that
describes the interaction between the qubits in our system
(see :func:`~pennylane.pulse.transmon_interaction`), and a time-dependent drive term that
accounts for the pulse (see :func:`~pennylane.pulse.transmon_drive`). The time-dependent
Hamiltonian for a driven qubit is:

.. math:: H = \underbrace{-\frac{\omega_q}{2}\sigma^z}_{H_{int}} + \underbrace{\Omega(t)\sin(\phi(t) + \omega_p t)\sigma^y\,}_{H_{drive}},

where :math:`\omega_q,\omega_p` are the frequencies of the qubit and the pulse, respectively, and
:math:`\sigma^y,\sigma^z` denote the second and third Pauli matrices.

In order to keep the implementation as simple as possible, we will work with a single-qubit
device. At the end of the demo, we provide insights on how to extend the implementation to
multi-qubit devices and gates.

# Now that we have a model of the quantum computer and we have defined the environment's states, we

# :math:`\omega_p=\omega_q.`
#
# Hence, we will let the agent change the amplitude and the phase for every segment in our pulse

######################################################################
# Finally, we need to define the reward function. In the typical reinforcement learning setting, there
# are rewards after every action is performed, as in the schematic depiction above. However, in some
# cases, those rewards are zero until the task is finished. For example, if we are training an agent
# to play chess, we cannot evaluate every single move on its own, and we need to wait until the game
# is resolved in order to provide the agent with a meaningful reward.
#
# Our case is similar to the chess example. The intermediate states visited along the time evolution
# do not necessarily provide a clear indication of how well the target gate is being executed. It
# is only once we have gone through all the pulse segments that we can see the final outcome and
# evaluate it as a whole, just like a chess strategy is evaluated based on the match's result. The
# reward will be the average gate fidelity of our pulse program with respect to the target gate.
#
# In order to evaluate it, we sample several random initial states and apply the pulse program a few
# consecutive times. Then, we compute the average fidelity between the resulting intermediate and
# final states from our pulse, and the expected states from the target gate. Finally, we take the
# weighted average of all the fidelities, giving more relevance to the initial gate applications. This
# process of repeatedly applying the pulse programs accumulates the errors, making our reward function
# more sensitive to them. This allows the agent to better refine the pulse programs.
#
# The number of initial states and gate repetitions are hyperparameters that will add up really
# quickly with others such as the pulse duration, the segment duration, and so on. In order to keep
# the code as clean as possible, we will put all of them in a ``config`` container (a jit-friendly

# The agent
# `````````
#
# The agent is a rather simple entity: it observes a state from the environment and selects an action
# among the ones we have defined above. The action selection is performed according to a policy, which
# is typically denoted by :math:`\pi.` In this case, we will use a stochastic policy
# :math:`\pi_{\mathbf{\theta}}(a_i|s_t)` that provides the probability of choosing the action
# :math:`a_i` given an observed state :math:`s_t` at a given time :math:`t,` according to some
# parameters :math:`\mathbf{\theta}.` Learning the optimal policy :math:`\pi^*` will consist on
# learning the parameters :math:`\mathbf{\theta}^*` that best approximate it
# :math:`\pi_{\mathbf{\theta}^*}\approx\pi^*.`
#
# We parametrize the policy with a small feed-forward neural network that takes the state :math:`s_t`
# as input, and provides the probability to select every action :math:`a_i` at the end. Therefore, the
# input and output layers have ``state_size=2`` and ``n_actions=88`` neurons, respectively. We include
# a hidden layer in between with a hyperbolic tangent activation function. Let's implement this with
# `Flax <https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

# To act in the environment, we simply need to pass the state through the network and sample an action

#

######################################################################
# The learning algorithm
# ``````````````````````
#
# Among the plethora of reinforcement learning algorithms, we use the REINFORCE [#Williams1992]_
# algorithm. It belongs to the policy gradient algorithms family, which proposes a parametrization of
# the policy (as we have conveniently done in the previous section) and directly optimizes its
# parameters. The main principle of REINFORCE is to directly modify the policy to favour series of
# actions within the agent's experience that have led to high rewards. This way, past beneficial
# actions are more likely to happen again.
#
# We achieve this by maximizing the expected *return* of the policy. To keep it simple, we can
# understand the return (typically :math:`G`) as the weighted sum of rewards along an *episode*, which
# are full executions of our reinforcement learning “game”. In our case, an episode would be the full
# execution of a pulse program, which is comprised by several interactions between the agent and the
# environment. Since the reward will only be given at the end, we will take the return to be the final
# reward.
#
# We perform the maximization of the expected return by gradient ascent over the policy parameters. We
# can compute the gradient of the expected return as follows
#
# .. math:: \nabla_{\mathbf{\theta}} \mathbb{E}\left[G\right] = \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}G_t\nabla_{\mathbf{\theta}}\log\pi_{\mathbf{\theta}}(a_t|s_t)\right],
#
# where the expectation values are over episodes sampled following the policy
# :math:`\pi_{\mathbf{\theta}}.` The sum goes over the episode time steps :math:`t,` where the agent
# observes the state :math:`s_t` and chooses to perform the action :math:`a_t.` The term
# :math:`\nabla_{\mathbf{\theta}}\log\pi_{\mathbf{\theta}}(a_t|s_t)` is known as the *score function*
# and it is the gradient of the logarithm of the probability with which the action is taken. Finally,
# :math:`G_t` is the return associated to the episode from time :math:`t` onwards, which is always the
# final reward of the episode, as we mentioned. This expression allows us to compute the gradient
# of our policy parameters without explicitly modeling the environment, hence the name "model-free"
# reinforcement learning.
#
# .. note::
#     At time :math:`t,` an action :math:`a_t` on state :math:`s_t`` leads to the next state
#     :math:`s_{t+1}` and yields a reward :math:`r_{t+1}.` The final action is taken at time
#     :math:`T-1` which yields the final state :math:`s_T` and reward :math:`r_T.` The return is
#     the weighted sum of rewards obtained along an episode:
#
#     .. math:: G=\sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \gamma^t r_{t+1}\,
#
#     where :math:`\gamma\in[0, 1]` is a *discount factor* that favours early rewards vs latter
#     ones. For instance, :math:`\gamma\to0` only values immediate rewards, whereas
#     :math:`\gamma\to1` accounts equally for all the rewards regardless of the time. The return
#     from time :math:`t` weights the rewards relative to the given time:
#
#     .. math:: G_t=\sum_{k=0}^{T-1-t} \gamma^k r_{k+t+1},
#
#     where :math:`k` denotes the number of steps after :math:`t.` Note that
#     :math:`G\equiv G_{t=0}` by definition. The return can also be computed recursively following
#     the relationship :math:`G_t = r_{t+1} + \gamma G_{t+1},` a property exploited by some
#     reinforcement learning algorithms.
#
#     In our case, we're in the limit of :math:`\gamma=1,` provided that we only consider the final
#     reward :math:`r_T` (:math:`r_{t\neq T}=0`) and we fix the total number of interactions
#     :math:`T` beforehand, given by the number of pulse segments. This greatly simplifies the
#     expressions and the return is :math:`G=G_t=r_T \,\forall t.`
#
# To learn the optimal policy, we can estimate the gradient
# :math:`\nabla_{\mathbf{\theta}} \mathbb{E}\left[G\right]` by sampling a bunch of episodes following
# the current policy :math:`\pi_{\mathbf{\theta}}.` Then, we can perform a gradient ascent update to
# the policy parameters :math:`\mathbf{\theta},` sample some episodes with the new parameters, and
# repeat until we converge to the optimal policy.
#
# Let's implement these ideas one by one, starting by the episode sampling. The episodes start with
# the qubit in the :math:`|0\rangle` state. Then, we start the observe-act loop, where the agent
# observes the qubit's state and chooses the parameters for the next pulse segment according to its
# policy. We can sample the action and compute the score function at the same time to make the code as
# efficient as possible. Finally, when we reach the end of the pulse program, we compute its reward.
# We like it when things go fast, so we'll sample all the episodes in parallel!

# In order to compute the gradient, we need to compute the sum within the expectation value for every
# episode. However, we will give this expression a twist and bring our reinforcement learning skills a
# step further. We will subtract a baseline :math:`b` to the return such that
#
# .. math:: \nabla_{\mathbf{\theta}} \mathbb{E}\left[G\right] = \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}(G_t - b(s_t))\nabla_{\mathbf{\theta}}\log\pi_{\mathbf{\theta}}(a_t|s_t)\right].
#
# Intuitively, the magnitude of the reward is arbitrary and depends on our function of choice. Hence,
# it provides the same information if we shift it. For example, our reward based on the average gate
# fidelity is bound between zero and one, but everything would conceptually be the same if we added
# one. In a sense, we could consider the original expression to have a baseline of zero, and this new
# one to be a generalization. Any baseline is valid provided that it does not depend on the action
# :math:`a_t` because this ensures it has a null expectation value, leaving the gradient unaffected.
#
# While these baselines leave the expectation value of the gradient unchanged, they do have an impact
# in its variance. Here, we will implement the optimal state-independent baseline that minimizes the
# variance of the gradient. The optimal baseline for the :math:`k`-th component of the gradient is:
#
# .. math:: b_k = \frac{\mathbb{E}\left[G_t\left(\partial_{\theta_k}\log\pi_{\mathbf{\theta}}(a|s)\right)^2\right]}{\mathbb{E}\left[\left(\partial_{\theta_k}\log\pi_{\mathbf{\theta}}(a|s)\right)^2\right]}\,,
#
# where :math:`\partial_{\theta_k}\log\pi_{\mathbf{\theta}}(a|s)` is the :math:`k`-th component of the
# score function. Thus, this baseline has the same shape as the gradient. You can find a proof in
# Chapter 6.3.1 in [#Dawid22]_. Reducing the variance of our
# estimates significantly speeds up the training process by providing better gradient updates with
# less samples.

# Beyond single-qubit quantum computers and gates
# -----------------------------------------------
#
# All the concepts that we have learned throughout the demo are directly applicable to quantum
# computers with more qubits, two-qubit gates, and even other platforms beyond superconducting
# circuits. Perhaps the most straightforward extension of the code presented here would be calibrating
# an entangling gate, such as a CNOT. We will provide an overview of how to adapt this demo to do
# it, although they take significantly longer to train (mainly because the pulses need to be much
# longer).
#
# The first thing we need to build an entangling gate is a second qubit in our device with a different
# frequency coupled to the first one.
#

# Quantum computer
qubit_freqs = [4.81, 4.88]  # GHz

couplings = [0.02]

######################################################################
# The CNOT gate is typically constituted by a series of single-qubit pulses and cross-resonant (CR)
# pulses. Every single-qubit pulse is resonant with the qubit it targets, i.e., it has the same
# frequency, whereas CR pulses are shone on the control qubit at the target's frequency. This way, the
# target is indirectly driven through the coupling with the control qubit, which entangles them.
#
# We will make the CR pulse take the first qubit as control and the second as target. We will
# implement what's known as an echoed CR pulse, which consists of flipping the state of the control
# qubit (applying an :math:`X` gate) in the middle of the CR pulse. The second half of the pulse is
# the negative of the previous one. This “echoes out” the rapid interactions between the qubits, while
# preserving the entangling slower interaction that we are interested in, as introduced in [#SheldonPRA16]_.
#
# Our full pulse ansatz will consist of sandwiching the echoed CR gate between single qubit pulses.
# Therefore, we will have a total of six PWC pulses: two single qubit ones, two CR, and two single
# qubit.

# The state of the environment is now a 2-qubit state for which on the quantum computer we need to
# perform :math:`\mathcal{O}(4^2)` measurements for tomography.
# We would need to decide how many segments we wish to split each pulse into, and define the
# appropriate ``time_window`` within ``play_episodes``. This can be achieved by modifying the 
# ``config.segment_duration`` to be an array that contains the time spans of every segment, such
# that ``time_window = config.segment_duration[s]``, or similar. Given that the negative CR pulse
# uses the same parameters as the positive CR one, we can skip it as an entire segment merged with
# the last from the positive one that does not involve any intermediate tomography steps.
#
# Finally, when dealing with quantum computers with several qubits, we can opt for two strategies:
# train specialized calibrators for every qubit (or qubit pair), or train a single general
# calibrator for all the qubits. In these cases, we need to define a separate drive Hamiltonian for
# each individual qubit.
# Training individual specialized agents can be done in parallel following the same principles
# introduced in this demo, which will make them robust to the various sources of noise.
# Training a general agent is a bit more involved to adapt. Mainly, every episode
# controls the evolution of a randomly selected qubit with its own ``H_drive``. This involves
# modifying ``play_episodes`` to sample the selected qubits, and carry their evolution under their
# respective Hamiltonians. Notice that ``evolve_states`` should be parallelized over the
# Hamiltonian too.

# Conclusions
# -----------
#
# In this demo, we have learned how to design an experimentally-friendly calibrator with
# reinforcement learning. To do so, we have learned the fundamental principles of reinforcement
# learning, the REINFORCE algorithm, and how to frame the calibration of quantum computers within
# this framework. Then, we have put everything together to calibrate a single-qubit gate, and we
# have learned how to apply the principles explored here to gates involving multiple qubits and
# larger devices.
#
# The method presented in this demo has several strengths. First of all, it does not require any
# model or prior information about the quantum computer, making it widely applicable across
# different quantum computing platforms, even though we have only showed an application on a
# superconducting quantum computer. Furthermore, once we have invested resources in training the
# reinforcement learning calibrator, we can use it to recalibrate the qubits multiple times at a
# very low cost. In [#BaumPRXQ21]_, the authors report an average gate fidelity of 0.995 on a
# 2-qubit gate, and 0.993 after 25 days of training!
#
# To continue learning about this topic, try implementing one of the two extensions we explain above.
# To learn more about reinforcement learning, we recommend [#SuttonBarto18]_ for an introduction to
# the topic, and [#Dawid22]_ for an introduction of machine learning for physics (reinforcement
# learning in chapter 6). To learn more about how superconducting
# quantum computers work, see [#KrantzAPR19]_ for an extensive review, and the related `PennyLane
# documentation <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/qml_pulse.html>`__.

r"""Linear combination of unitaries and block encodings
=============================================================

If I (Juan Miguel) had to summarize quantum computing in one sentence, it would be this: information is
encoded in quantum states and processed using `unitary operations <https://codebook.xanadu.ai/I.3>`_.
The challenge of quantum algorithms is to design and build these unitaries to perform interesting and
useful tasks with the encoded information. My colleague `Nathan Wiebe <https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=DSgKHOQAAAAJ&hl=en>`_
once told me that some of his early research was motivated by a simple
question: Quantum computers can implement products of unitaries --- after all,
that's how we build circuits from a `universal gate set <https://codebook.xanadu.ai/I.7>`_.
But what about **sums of unitaries**? 🤔

In this tutorial, we will teach you the basics of one of the most versatile tools in quantum algorithms:
*linear combinations of unitaries*, or LCUs for short. You will also understand how to
use LCUs to create another powerful building block of quantum algorithms: block encodings.
Among their many uses, block encodings allow us to transform quantum states by non-unitary
operators, and they are useful in a variety of contexts, perhaps most famously in
`qubitization <https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06546>`_ and the `quantum
singular value transformation (QSVT) <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_intro_qsvt>`_.

LCUs
----
Linear combinations of unitaries are straightforward --- it’s already explained in the name: we
decompose operators into a weighted sum of unitaries. Mathematically, this means expressing
an operator :math:`A` in terms of coefficients :math:`\alpha_{k}` and unitaries :math:`U_{k}` as

.. math:: A =  \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \alpha_k U_k.

A general way to build LCUs is to employ properties of the **Pauli basis**.
This is the set of all products of Pauli matrices :math:`\{I, X, Y, Z\}`. For the space of operators
acting on :math:`n` qubits, this set forms a complete basis. Thus, any operator can be expressed in the Pauli basis,
which immediately gives an LCU decomposition. PennyLane allows you to decompose any matrix into the Pauli basis using the
:func:`~.pennylane.pauli_decompose` function. The coefficients :math:`\alpha_k` and the unitaries
:math:`U_k` from the decomposition can be accessed directly from the result. We show how to do this
in the code below for a simple example.

"""
import numpy as np
import pennylane as qml

a = 0.25
b = 0.75

# matrix to be decomposed
A = np.array(
    [[a,  0, 0,  b],
     [0, -a, b,  0],
     [0,  b, a,  0],
     [b,  0, 0, -a]]
)

LCU = qml.pauli_decompose(A)

print(f"LCU decomposition:\n {LCU}")
print(f"Coefficients:\n {LCU.coeffs}")
print(f"Unitaries:\n {LCU.ops}")

# PennyLane uses a smart Pauli decomposition based on vectorizing the matrix and exploiting properties of
# the `Walsh-Hadamard transform <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_transform>`_,
# but the cost still scales as ~ :math:`O(n 4^n)` for :math:`n` qubits, so be careful.
#
# It's good to remember that many types of Hamiltonians are already compactly expressed
# in the Pauli basis, for example in various `Ising models <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model>`_
# and molecular Hamiltonians using the `Jordan-Wigner transformation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan%E2%80%93Wigner_transformation>`_.
# This is very useful since we get an LCU decomposition for free.
#
# Block Encodings
# ---------------
# Going from an LCU to a quantum circuit that applies the associated operator is also straightforward
# once you know the trick: to prepare, select, and unprepare.
#
# Starting from the LCU decomposition :math:`A =  \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \alpha_k U_k` with positive, real
# coefficients, we define the prepare (PREP) operator:
#
# .. math:: \text{PREP}|0\rangle = \sum_k \sqrt{\frac{|\alpha_k|}{\lambda}}|k\rangle,
#
# where :math:`\lambda` is a normalization constant defined as :math:`\lambda = \sum_k |\alpha_k|`,
# and the select (SEL) operator:
#
# .. math:: \text{SEL}|k\rangle |\psi\rangle = |k\rangle U_k |\psi\rangle.
#
# They are aptly named: PREP prepares a state whose amplitudes
# are determined by the coefficients of the LCU, and SEL selects which unitary is applied.
# 
# .. note::
#
#   Some important details about the equations above:
#
#   * :math:`SEL` acts this way on any state :math:`|\psi\rangle`
#   * We are using :math:`|0\rangle` as shorthand to denote the all-zero state for multiple qubits.
#
# The final trick is to combine PREP and SEL to make :math:`A` appear 🪄:
#
# .. math:: \langle 0| \text{PREP}^\dagger \cdot \text{SEL} \cdot \text{PREP} |0\rangle|\psi\rangle = \frac{A}{\lambda} |\psi\rangle.
#
# If you're up for it, it's illuminating to go through the math and show how :math:`A` comes out on the right
# side of the equation.
# (Tip: calculate the action of :math:`\text{PREP}^\dagger` on :math:`\langle 0|`, not on the output
# state after :math:`\text{SEL} \cdot \text{PREP}`).
#
# Otherwise, the intuitive way to understand this equation is that we apply PREP, SEL, and then invert PREP. If
# we measure :math:`|0\rangle` in the auxiliary qubits, the input state :math:`|\psi\rangle` will be transformed by
# :math:`A` (up to normalization). The figure below shows this as a circuit with four unitaries in SEL.

#
# The circuit
#
# .. math:: U = \text{PREP}^\dagger \cdot \text{SEL} \cdot \text{PREP}
#
# is a **block encoding** of :math:`A`, up to normalization. The reason for this name is that if we write :math:`U`
# as a matrix, the operator :math:`A` is encoded inside a block of :math:`U` as
#
# .. math:: U = \begin{bmatrix} A & \cdot \\ \cdot & \cdot \end{bmatrix}.
#
# This block is defined by the subspace of all states where the auxiliary qubits are in state
# :math:`|0\rangle`.
#
#
# PennyLane supports the direct implementation of `prepare <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.StatePrep.html>`_
# and `select <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.Select.html>`_
# operators. We'll go through them individually and use them to construct a block encoding circuit.
# Prepare circuits can be constructed using the :class:`~.pennylane.StatePrep` operation, which takes
# the normalized target state as input:

dev1 = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=1)

# normalized square roots of coefficients
alphas = (np.sqrt(LCU.coeffs) / np.linalg.norm(np.sqrt(LCU.coeffs)))


@qml.qnode(dev1)
def prep_circuit():
    qml.StatePrep(alphas, wires=0)
    return qml.state()


print("Target state: ", alphas)
print("Output state: ", np.real(prep_circuit()))

##############################################################################
# Similarly, select circuits can be implemented using :class:`~.pennylane.Select`, which takes the
# target unitaries as input. We specify the control wires directly, but the system wires are inherited
# from the unitaries. Since :func:`~.pennylane.pauli_decompose` uses a canonical wire ordering, we
# first map the wires to those used for the system register in our circuit:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

dev2 = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=3)

# unitaries
ops = LCU.ops
# relabeling wires: 0 → 1, and 1 → 2
unitaries = [qml.map_wires(op, {0: 1, 1: 2}) for op in ops]


@qml.qnode(dev2)
def sel_circuit(qubit_value):
    qml.BasisState(qubit_value, wires=0)
    qml.Select(unitaries, control=0)
    return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(2))

qml.draw_mpl(sel_circuit, style='pennylane')([0])
plt.show()
##############################################################################
# Based on the controlled operations, the circuit above will flip the measured qubit
# if the input is :math:`|1\rangle` and leave it unchanged if the
# input is :math:`|0\rangle`. The output expectation values correspond to these states:

print('Expectation value for input |0>:', sel_circuit([0]))
print('Expectation value for input |1>:', sel_circuit([1]))

##############################################################################
# We can now combine these to construct a full LCU circuit. Here we make use of the
# :func:`~.pennylane.adjoint` function as a convenient way to invert the prepare circuit. We have
# chosen an input matrix that is already normalized, so it can be seen appearing directly in the
# top-left block of the unitary describing the full circuit --- the mark of a successful block
# encoding.


@qml.qnode(dev2)
def lcu_circuit():  # block_encode
    # PREP
    qml.StatePrep(alphas, wires=0)

    # SEL
    qml.Select(unitaries, control=0)

    # PREP_dagger
    qml.adjoint(qml.StatePrep(alphas, wires=0))
    return qml.state()


output_matrix = qml.matrix(lcu_circuit)()
print("A:\n", A, "\n")

# Application: Projectors
# -----------------------
# Suppose we wanted to project our quantum state :math:`|\psi\rangle` onto the state
# :math:`|\phi\rangle`. We could accomplish this by applying the projector
# :math:`| \phi \rangle\langle \phi |` to :math:`|\psi\rangle`. However, we cannot directly apply
# projectors as gates in our quantum circuits because they are **not** unitary operations.
# We can instead use a simple LCU decomposition which holds for any projector:
#
# .. math::
#      | \phi \rangle\langle \phi | = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \mathbb{I} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot (2 \cdot | \phi \rangle\langle \phi | - \mathbb{I})
#
# Both terms in the expression above are unitary (try proving it for yourself). We can now use this
# LCU decomposition to block-encode the projector! As an example, let's block-encode the projector
# :math:`| 0 \rangle\langle 0 |` that projects a state to the :math:`|0\rangle` state:
#
# .. math:: | 0 \rangle\langle 0 | =  \begin{bmatrix}
#                                       1 & 0 \\
#                                       0 & 0 \\
#                                     \end{bmatrix}.
#

coeffs = np.array([1/2, 1/2])
alphas = np.sqrt(coeffs) / np.linalg.norm(np.sqrt(coeffs))

proj_unitaries = [qml.Identity(0), qml.PauliZ(0)]

##############################################################################
# Note that the second term in our LCU simplifies to a Pauli :math:`Z` operation. We can now
# construct a full LCU circuit and verify that :math:`| 0 \rangle\langle 0 |` is block-encoded in
# the top left block of the matrix.

def lcu_circuit():  # block_encode
    # PREP
    qml.StatePrep(alphas, wires="ancilla")

    # SEL
    qml.Select(proj_unitaries, control="ancilla")

    # PREP_dagger
    qml.adjoint(qml.StatePrep(alphas, wires="ancilla"))
    return qml.state()


output_matrix = qml.matrix(lcu_circuit, wire_order=[0, "ancilla"])()
print("Block-encoded projector:\n")
print(np.real(np.round(output_matrix,2)))

# Final thoughts
# -------------------
# LCUs and block encodings are often associated with advanced algorithms that require the full power
# of fault-tolerant quantum computers. The truth is that they are basic constructions with
# broad applicability that can be useful for all kinds of hardware and simulators. If you're working
# on quantum algorithms and applications in any capacity, these are techniques that you should
# master, and PennyLane is equipped with the tools to help you get there.

r"""How to implement the HHL algorithm using Qrisp and Catalyst?
============================================================

The Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) quantum algorithm offers an exponential speed-up over classical
methods for solving linear system problems :math:`Ax=b` for certain sparse matrices :math:`A`. In
this demo, you will learn how to implement this algorithm in the high-level language
`Qrisp <https://www.qrisp.eu>`__.

The program features hybrid quantum-classical workflows and is
compiled using `Catalyst <https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/catalyst/en/stable/index.html>`__, a
quantum just-in-time (QJIT) compiler framework. The goal of this demo is to showcase how Qrisp and
Catalyst complement each other for implementing advanced quantum algorithms and compiling them for
practically relevant problem sizes.

In order to make this demo self-sufficient, it is structured such that it first offers a brief
introduction to Qrisp, QuantumVariables and QuantumTypes, the implementation of Quantum Phase
Estimation (QPE), before putting it into a higher gear with the HHL implementation and showcase of
the Catalyst features.

Intro to Qrisp
--------------

Since this demo is featured here, you may not have heard about Qrisp
yet. If you feel addressed with this assumption, please don’t fret—we explain all the concepts
necessary for you to follow along even if not already fluent in Qrisp. So, join us on this Magical
Mystery Tour in the world of Qrisp, Catalyst, and HHL.

What is Qrisp? Qrisp [#qrisp_2024]_ is a high-level open-source programming framework. It offers an alternative
approach to circuit construction and algorithm development with its defining
feature—QuantumVariables. This approach allows the user to step away from focusing on qubits and
gates for circuit construction when developing algorithms, and instead allows the user to code in
terms of variables and functions similarly to how one would program classically.

Qrisp also supports a modular architecture, allowing you to use, replace, and optimize code
components easily. We'll demonstrate this later in this demo.

You can install Qrisp to experiment with this implementation yourself, at your own pace, by calling
``pip install qrisp``.

QuantumVariable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The QuantumVariable is the primary building block in Qrisp. It abstracts away the details of qubit
management, offering a range of features like infix arithmetic syntax and strong typing through
class inheritance. This simplification allows developers to focus on the algorithm logic rather than
the underlying circuit construction details.

Creating your first QuantumVariable is easy:

# Jasp
# ~~~~
#
# Jasp is a submodule of Qrisp that allows you to scale up your Qrisp code to practically relevant
# problem sizes. Apart from significantly speeding up compilation, Jasp provides the functionality to
# integrate classical real-time computations.
#
# .. admonition:: What is a real-time computation?
#     :class: note
#
#     A real-time computation is a classical computation that happens during the quantum
#     computation, while the quantum computer stays in superposition. This computation has to happen much
#     faster than the coherence time, so performing that computation by waiting for the Python interpreter
#     is impossible. Real-time computations are essential for many techniques in error correction, such as
#     syndrome decoding or `magic state distillation <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_magic_state_distillation>`__. On the algorithmic level, real-time computations have also
#     become more popular since they are so much cheaper than the quantum equivalent. Examples are
#     Gidney’s adder or repeat until success protocols like HHL.
#
# Jasp is a module that provides `JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html>`__
# primitives for Qrisp syntax and therefore makes Qrisp JAX-traceable. How does this work in practice?
# The central class here is Jaspr, which is a subtype of Jaxpr. Jaspr objects are intermediate
# representations of Qrisp programs and can be compiled to
# `QIR <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/concepts-qir>`__ using the Catalyst framework.
#
# The Qrisp syntax is intended to work seamlessly in the regular Python mode, primarily for learning,
# testing, and experimenting with small scale quantum programs, as well as in Jasp mode for large scale
# quantum programs with real-time hybrid computations running on fault-tolerant quantum hardware.
#
# QPE in Qrisp
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# For deepening your understanding of QPE, we would like to refer you to the `Intro
# to Quantum Phase Estimation demo <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qpe>`__, and instead focus on how QPE is implemented
# in Qrisp, and later showcase how to use it in the HHL implementation.
#
# .. admonition:: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)
#     :class: note
#
#     Quantum Phase Estimation is an important subroutine in many quantum algorithms, like
#     the HHL as you will get to learn. A short summary of what problem QPE solves can be stated as:
#
#     Given a unitary :math:`U` and quantum state :math:`|\psi\rangle` which is an eigenvector of :math:`U`:
#
#     .. math::  U |\psi\rangle = e^{i 2 \pi \phi}|\psi\rangle
#
#     applying quantum phase estimation to :math:`U` and :math:`|\psi\rangle` returns a quantum register
#     containing an estimate for the value of :math:`\phi`,
#     i.e. :math:`\text{QPE}_{U} |\psi\rangle |0\rangle = |\psi\rangle |\phi\rangle`.
#
# This can be implemented within a few lines of code in Qrisp:


def QPE(psi, U, precision=None, res=None):

    if res is None:
        res = qrisp.QuantumFloat(precision, -precision)

    qrisp.h(res)

    # Performs a loop with a dynamic bound in Jasp mode.
    for i in qrisp.jrange(res.size):
        with qrisp.control(res[i]):
            for j in qrisp.jrange(2**i):
                U(psi)

    return qrisp.QFT(res, inv=True)


######################################################################
# The first step here is to create the QuantumFloat ``res`` which will contain the result. The first
# argument specifies the amount of mantissa qubits the QuantumFloat should contain and the second
# argument specifies the exponent. Having :math:`n` mantissa qubits and exponent of :math:`-n`
# means that this QuantumFloat can represent values between 0 and 1 with a granularity of
# :math:`2^{-n}`. Subsequently, we apply an Hadamard gate to all qubits of ``res`` and continue by
# performing controlled evaluations of :math:`U`. This is achieved by using the
# ``with control(res[i]):`` statement. This statement enters a ControlEnvironment such that every
# quantum operation inside the indented code block will be controlled on the :math:`i`-th qubit of
# ``res``. The ``for i in jrange(res.size)``\ statement performs a loop with a dynamic bound in Jasp
# mode. The intricacies of what exactly this means are beyond the scope of this demo. You can just
# treat it like a normal ``range``. We conclude the algorithm by performing an inverse quantum fourier
# transformation of ``res``.
#
# Note that compared to other similar implementations, :math:`U` is given as a Python function
# (instead of a circuit object), allowing for slim and elegant implementations.
#
# Let’s take a look at a simple example.


import numpy as np


def U(psi):
    phi_1 = 0.5
    phi_2 = 0.125

    qrisp.p(phi_1 * 2 * np.pi, psi[0])  # p applies a phase gate
    qrisp.p(phi_2 * 2 * np.pi, psi[1])


psi = qrisp.QuantumFloat(2)
qrisp.h(psi)

res = QPE(psi, U, precision=3)

######################################################################
# In this code snippet, we define a function ``U`` which applies a phase gate onto the first two
# qubits of its input. We then create the QuantumVariable ``psi`` and bring it into uniform
# superposition by applying Hadamard gates onto each qubit. Subsequently, we evaluate QPE on ``U`` and
# ``psi`` with the precision 3.
#
# The quantum state is now:
#
# .. math::  \frac{1}{2} \text{QPE}_{U}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle + |2\rangle + |3\rangle)|0\rangle = \frac{1}{2} (|0\rangle|0\rangle + |1\rangle|\phi_1\rangle + |2\rangle|\phi_2\rangle +|3\rangle|\phi_1 + \phi_2\rangle)
#
# We verify by measuring ``psi`` together with ``res``:


print(qrisp.multi_measurement([psi, res]))

# .. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out
#
# .. code-block:: none

#    {(0, 0.0): 0.25, (1, 0.5): 0.25, (2, 0.125): 0.25, (3, 0.625): 0.25}

######################################################################
# Here, the measurement results are given by a dictionary, where the keys are are tuples representing
# the values of ``psi`` and ``res``, and the corresponding values are the measurement probabilities.
#
# This example can also seamlessly be executed in Jasp mode: In this case, the ``terminal_sampling``
# decorator performs a hybrid simulation and afterwards samples from the resulting quantum state.


@qrisp.terminal_sampling
def main():
    qf = qrisp.QuantumFloat(2)
    qf[:] = 3

    res = QPE(qf, U, precision=3)

    return res


main()

# Executing the ``main`` function with the ``terminal_sampling`` decorator returns the measurement

#
#
# The HHL algorithm
# -----------------
#
# Given an :math:`N`-by-:math:`N` Hermitian matrix :math:`A` and an :math:`N`-dimensional vector
# :math:`b`, the Quantum Linear Systems Problem (QSLP) consists of preparing a quantum state
# :math:`|x\rangle` with amplitudes proportional to the solution :math:`x` of the linear system of
# equations :math:`Ax=b`. Thereby, it can exhibit an exponential speedup over classical methods for
# certain sparse matrices :math:`A`. The HHL quantum algorithm [#HHL_2009]_, [#HHL_step-by-step_2023]_ and, more generally, quantum linear
# systems algorithms, hold significant promise for accelerating computations in fields that rely
# heavily on solving linear systems of equations, such as `solving differential
# equations <https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01054v4>`__, or accelerating machine learning.
#
# In its eigenbasis, the matrix :math:`A` can be written as
#
# .. math::  A = \sum_i \lambda_i|u_i\rangle\langle u_i|
#
# where :math:`|u_i\rangle` is an eigenvector of :math:`A` corresponding to the eigenvalue
# :math:`\lambda_i`.
#
# We define the quantum states :math:`|b\rangle` and :math:`|x\rangle` as
#
# .. math::  |b\rangle = \dfrac{\sum_i b_i|i\rangle}{\|\sum_i b_i|i\rangle\|} = \sum_i \beta_i|u_i\rangle \quad\text{and}\quad |x\rangle = \dfrac{\sum_i x_i|i\rangle}{\|\sum_i x_i|i\rangle\|} = \sum_i \gamma_i|u_i\rangle
#
# where :math:`|b\rangle` and :math:`|x\rangle` are expressed in the eigenbasis of :math:`A`.
#
# Solving the linear system amounts to
#
# .. math:: \begin{align}|x\rangle&=A^{-1}|b\rangle\\&=\bigg(\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\lambda_i^{-1}|u_i\rangle\langle u_i|\bigg)\sum_j\beta_j|u_j\rangle\\&=\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\lambda_i^{-1}\beta_i|u_i\rangle\end{align}
#
# You might wonder why we can’t just apply :math:`A^{-1}` directly to :math:`|b\rangle`? This is
# because, in general, the matix :math:`A` is not unitary. However, we will circumnavigate this by
# exploiting that the Hamiltonian evolution :math:`U=e^{itA}` is unitary for a Hermitian matrix
# :math:`A`. And this brings us to the HHL algorithm.
#
# In theory, the HHL algorithm can be described as follows:
#
# - Step 1: We start by preparing the state
#
#   .. math::  |\Psi_1\rangle = |b\rangle = \sum_i \beta_i|u_i\rangle
#
# - Step 2: Applying **Quantum Phase Estimation** with respect to the Hamiltonian evolution
#   :math:`U=e^{itA}` yields the state
#
#   .. math::  |\Psi_2\rangle = \sum_i \beta_i|u_i\rangle|\lambda_jt/2\pi\rangle = \sum_i \beta_i|u_i\rangle|\widetilde{\lambda}_i\rangle
#
#   To simplify notation, we write :math:`\widetilde{\lambda}_i=\lambda_jt/2\pi`.
#
# - Step 3: Performing the inversion of the eigenvalues
#   :math:`\widetilde{\lambda}_i\rightarrow\widetilde{\lambda}_i^{-1}` yields the state
#
#   .. math::  |\Psi_3\rangle = \sum_i \beta_i|u_i\rangle|\widetilde{\lambda}_i\rangle|\widetilde{\lambda}_i^{-1}\rangle
#
# - Step 4: The amplitudes are multiplied by the inverse eigenvalues
#   :math:`\widetilde{\lambda}_i^{-1}` to obtain the state
#
#   .. math::  |\Psi_4\rangle = \sum_i \lambda_i^{-1}\beta_i|u_i\rangle|\widetilde{\lambda}_i\rangle|\widetilde{\lambda}_i^{-1}\rangle
#
#   This is achieved by means of a repeat-until-success procedure that applies **Steps 1-3** as a
#   subroutine. Stay tuned for more details below!
#
# - Step 5: As a final step, we uncompute the variables :math:`|\widetilde{\lambda}^{-1}\rangle` and
#   :math:`|\widetilde{\lambda}\rangle`, and obtain the state
#
#   .. math::  |\Psi_5\rangle = \sum_i \lambda_i^{-1}\beta_i|u_i\rangle = |x\rangle
#
# This concludes the HHL algorithm. The variable initialized in state :math:`|b\rangle` is now found in
# state :math:`|x\rangle`. As shown in the original HHL paper, the
# runtime of this algorithm is :math:`\mathcal{O}(\log(N)s^2\kappa^2/\epsilon)` where :math:`s` and
# :math:`\kappa` are the sparsity and condition number of the matrix :math:`A`, respectively, and
# :math:`\epsilon` is the precision of the solution. The logarithmic dependence on the dimension
# :math:`N` is the source of an exponential advantage over classical methods.
#
#
#
# The HHL algorithm in Qrisp
# --------------------------
# Let’s put theory into practice and dive into an implementation of the HHL algorithm in Qrisp.
#
# As a first step, we define a function that performs the inversion :math:`\lambda\mapsto\lambda^{-1}`.
# In this example, we restrict ourselves to an implementation that works for values
# :math:`\lambda=2^{-k}` for :math:`k\in\mathbb N`. (As shown above, a general inversion is available
# in Qrisp and will soon be updated to be compatible with QJIT compilation!)


def fake_inversion(qf, res=None):

    if res is None:
        res = qrisp.QuantumFloat(qf.size + 1)

    for i in qrisp.jrange(qf.size):
        qrisp.cx(qf[i], res[qf.size - i])

    return res


######################################################################
# .. tip::
#     Essentially, the controlled-NOT operations in the loop reverse the positions of the bits in input
#     variable and place them in the result variable in the opposite order. For example, for
#     :math:`\lambda=2^{-3}`, which is :math:`0.001` in binary, the function would produce
#     :math:`\lambda^{-1}=2^3`, which in binary is 1000.
#
# Let’s see if it works as intended.

# Next, we define the function ``HHL_encoding`` that performs **Steps 1-4** and prepares the state
# :math:`|\Psi_4\rangle`. But, how do get the values :math:`\widetilde{\lambda}^{-1}_i` into the
# amplitudes of the states, i.e. how do we go from :math:`|\Psi_3\rangle` to :math:`|\Psi_4\rangle`?
#
# Recently, efficient methods for black-box quantum state preparation that avoid arithmetic were
# proposed, see Bausch [#Bausch_2022]_ and Sanders et al. [#Sanders_2019]_. In this demo, we use a routine proposed in the latter
# reference which is based on a comparison between integers. This is implemented via the
# aforementioned comparisons for QuantumFloats.
#
# To simplify the notation, we write :math:`y^{(i)}=\widetilde{\lambda}^{-1}_i`. Recall that the
# values :math:`y^{(i)}` represent unsigned integers between :math:`0` and :math:`2^n-1$`.
#
# Starting from the state
#
# .. math::  |\Psi_3\rangle = \sum_i \beta_i|u_i\rangle|\widetilde{\lambda}_i\rangle|y^{(i)}\rangle_{\text{res}}
#
# we prepare a uniform superposition of :math:`2^n` states in a ``case_indicator`` QuantumFloat.
#
# .. math::  |\Psi_3'\rangle = \sum_i \beta_i|u_i\rangle|\widetilde{\lambda}_i\rangle|y^{(i)}\rangle_{\text{res}}\otimes\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}\sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1}|x\rangle_{\text{case}}
#
# Next, we calculate the comparison :math:`a\geq b` between the ``res`` and the ``case_indicator`` into a QuantumBool ``qbl``.
#
# .. math::  |\Psi_3''\rangle = \sum_i \beta_i|u_i\rangle|\widetilde{\lambda}_i\rangle|y^{(i)}\rangle_{\text{res}}\otimes\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}\left(\sum_{x=0}^{y^{(i)}-1}|x\rangle_{\text{case}}|0\rangle_{\text{qbl}} + \sum_{x=y^{(i)}}^{2^n-1}|x\rangle_{\text{case}}|1\rangle_{\text{qbl}}\right)
#
# Finally, the ``case_indicator`` is unprepared with :math:`n` Hadamards and we obtain the state
#
# .. math::  |\Psi_3'''\rangle = \sum_i \dfrac{y^{(i)}}{2^n}\beta_i|u_i\rangle|\widetilde{\lambda}_i\rangle|y^{(i)}\rangle_{\text{res}}|0\rangle_{\text{case}}|0\rangle_{\text{qbl}} + |\Phi\rangle
#
# where :math:`|\Phi\rangle` is an orthogonal state with the last variables not in :math:`|0\rangle_{\text{case}}|0\rangle_{\text{qbl}}`. Hence, upon measuring the ``case_indicator`` in state :math:`|0\rangle` and the target ``qbl`` in state :math:`|0\rangle`, the desired state is prepared.

# :math:`H` and the Hamiltonian evolution unitary :math:`U=e^{itH}` is obtained by Trotterization with
# one step (as the Pauli terms commute in this case). We choose :math:`t=\pi` to ensure that
# :math:`\widetilde{\lambda}_i=\lambda_i t/2\pi` are of the form :math:`2^{-k}` for a positive integer
# :math:`k`. This is enabled by the Qrisp’s ``QubitOperator`` class providing the tools to describe,
# optimize and efficiently simulate quantum Hamiltonians.

# First of all, kudos for making it to this point of the demo. Prior to proceeding to the final
# part of the demo showcasing the awesomeness of QJIT compilation with Catalyst, let’s rewind for
# a second, take a deep breath, and go through the steps and concepts you learned so far.
#
# .. admonition:: Intermezzo: Quick Recap
#     :class: note
#
#     Starting with getting familiar with Qrisp’s approach to programming through the use of
#     QuantumVariables, we foreshadowed the two QuantumTypes used in the implementation of HHL:
#     QuantumFloats, and QuantumBools. Following a quick mention of Jasp and the ability of doing
#     real-time computations using this module, the 'Qrisp-y' QPE implementation was demonstrated with a
#     simple example.
#
#     Equipped with a theoretical introduction to HHL and outlining the steps required to perform this
#     algorithm, you got to see how to first encode the first 4 steps and make use of the repeat until
#     success feature of Jasp.
#
#     Then, putting everything together, we combined the previously defined building blocks (read: Python
#     functions)—the HHL_encoding and QPE—into a simple function. With a brief feature appearance of
#     Hamiltonian simulation you then successfully managed to solve two systems of linear equations.
#
# Before moving on to the part of the demo showcasing Catalyst's capabilities, let’s
# appreciate one last time how elegantly we can call the HHL algorithm:
# ``x = HHL(b, hamiltonian_evolution, n, precision)``.
#

######################################################################
# QJIT compilation with Catalyst
# ------------------------------
# The solution that we saw so far only ran within the Python-based Qrisp internal simulator, which
# doesn’t have to care about silly things such as coherence time. Unfortunately, this is not (yet) the
# case for real quantum hardware so it is of paramount importance that the classical real-time
# computations (such as the while loop within the repeat-until-success steps) are executed as fast as
# possible. For this reason the QIR specification was created.
#
# QIR essentially embeds quantum aspects into `LLVM <https://llvm.org/docs/>`__, which is the
# foundation of a lot of modern compiler infrastructure. This implies QIR based software stacks are
# able to integrate a large part of established classical software and also express real-time control
# structures. Read more about QIR at the `QIR Alliance website <https://www.qir-alliance.org/>`__ and
# the `Advancing hybrid quantum–classical computation with real-time execution paper
# <https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physics/articles/10.3389/fphy.2022.940293/full>`__.
#
# Jasp has been built with a direct Catalyst integration implying Jasp programs can be converted to
# QIR via the Catalyst pipeline. This conversion is straightforward: You simply capture the Qrisp
# computation using the ``make_jaspr`` function and then call ``to_qir``.


def main():
    x = HHL(tuple(b), U, n, 4)
    # Note that we have to return a classical value
    # (in this case the measurement result of the
    # quantum variable returned by the HHL algorithm)
    # Within the above examples, we used the terminal_sampling
    # decorator, which is a convenience feature and allows
    # a much faster sampling procedure.
    # The terminal_sampling decorator expects a function returning
    # quantum variables, while most other evaluation modes require
    # classical return values.

# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# In this demo, we have shown how to implement the HHL algorithm featuring classical real-time
# computations in the high-level language Qrisp. This algorithm is important in a variety of use cases
# such as solving differential equations, accelerating machine learning, and more generally, any task
# that involves solving linear systems of equations. Along the way, we have dipped into advanced
# concepts such as Linear Combination of Unitaries and Hamiltonian simulation. Moreover, we have
# demonstrated how Qrisp and Catalyst complement each other for translating a high-level
# implementation into low-level QIR.

Contextuality and inductive bias in QML

######################################################################
# What machine learning problems are quantum computers likely to excel
# at?
#
# In the article *Contextuality and inductive bias in quantum machine
# learning* [#paper]_ by Joseph Bowles,
# Victoria J Wright, Máté Farkas, Nathan Killoran and Maria Schuld, we
# look to contextuality for answers to this question.
#
# Contextuality is a nonclassical phenomenon exhibited by quantum
# systems, and it is necessary for computational advantage relative to
# classical machines. To be a little more specific, we focus on the
# framework of *generalized
# contextuality* [#contextuality]_, 
# which was introduced by Robert Spekkens in 2004. We find learning
# problems for which contextuality plays a key role, and these problems
# may therefore be good areas where quantum machine learning algorithms
# shine. In this demo we will:
#
# -  Describe a specific example of a contextuality-relevant problem that is based on the
#    well-known rock-paper-scissors game, and
# -  Construct and train a quantum model that is tailored to the
#    symmetries of the problem.
#
# Throughout the demo we will make use of JAX to vectorise and just-in-time compile
# certain functions, which will speed things up. For more information on how to
# combine JAX and PennyLane, see the PennyLane
# `documentation <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/introduction/interfaces/jax.html>`__.

# Generalized contextuality
# -------------------------
#


######################################################################
# Suppose we want to prepare the maximally mixed state of a single qubit, 
# with :math:`\rho = \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{I}`. Although this corresponds to a
# single density matrix, there are many ways we could prepare the state.
# For example, we could mix the states :math:`\vert 0 \rangle` or
# :math:`\vert 1 \rangle` with equal probability. Alternatively, we could
# use the :math:`X` basis, and mix the states :math:`\vert + \rangle` or
# :math:`\vert - \rangle`. Even though this may not strike us as particularly
# strange, a remarkable coincidence is in fact going on here: an
# experimentalist can perform two physically distinct procedures (namely,
# preparing :math:`\rho` in the :math:`Z` or :math:`X` basis), however it
# is impossible to distinguish which procedure was performed, since they
# both result in the same density matrix and therefore give identical
# predictions for all future measurements.
#
# Such a coincidence demands an explanation. Something that one might expect
# is the following: the description of the experiment in terms of quantum
# states is not the most fundamental, and there are in fact other states
# (we’ll write them as :math:`\lambda`), that comprise our quantum states.
# In contextuality these are called *ontic states*, although they also go
# by the name of *hidden variables*. When we prepare a state
# :math:`\vert 0 \rangle`, :math:`\vert 1 \rangle`,
# :math:`\vert + \rangle`, :math:`\vert - \rangle`, what is really going
# on is that we prepare a mixture :math:`P_{\vert 0 \rangle}(\lambda)`,
# :math:`P_{\vert 1 \rangle}(\lambda)`,
# :math:`P_{\vert + \rangle}(\lambda)`,
# :math:`P_{\vert - \rangle}(\lambda)` over the true ontic states. One may
# imagine that the corresponding mixtures over the :math:`\lambda` s are
# the same for the :math:`Z` and :math:`X` basis preparation:
#
# .. math:: \frac{1}{2}P_{\vert 0 \rangle}(\lambda)+\frac{1}{2}P_{\vert 1 \rangle}(\lambda)=\frac{1}{2}P_{\vert + \rangle}(\lambda)+\frac{1}{2}P_{\vert - \rangle}(\lambda).
#
# This is a rather natural explanation of our coincidence: the two
# procedures are indistinguishable because they actually correspond to the
# same mixture over the fundamental states :math:`\lambda`. This sort of
# explanation is called *non-contextual*, since the two mixtures do not
# depend on the basis (that is, the context) in which the state is
# prepared. It turns out that if one tries to apply this logic to all the
# indistinguishabilities in quantum theory, one arrives at contradictions:
# it simply cannot be done. For this reason we say that quantum theory is
# a *contextual* theory.
#
# In the paper we frame generalized contextuality in the machine learning
# setting, which allows us to define what we mean by a contextual learning
# model. In a nutshell, this definition demands that if a learning model
# is non-contextual, then any indistinguishabilities in the model should
# be explained in a non-contextual way similar to the above. This results
# in constraints on the learning model, which limits their expressivity.
# Since quantum models are contextual, they can of course go beyond these
# constraints, and understanding when and how they do this may shed light
# on the non-classical features that separate quantum models from
# classical ones.
#
# Below we describe a specific learning problem that demonstrates this
# approach. As we will see, the corresponding indistinguishability relates
# to an *inductive bias* of the learning model.
#


######################################################################
# The rock-paper-scissors game
# ------------------------------
#


######################################################################
# The learning problem we will consider involves three players
# (we'll call them players 0, 1 and 2) playing a
# variant of the rock-paper-scissors game with a referee.
# The game goes as follows. In each round, a player can choose to play
# either rock (R), paper (P) or scissors (S). Each player also has a
# ‘special’ action. For player 0 it is R, for player 1 it is P and for
# player 2 it is S. The actions of the players are then compared pairwise,
# with the following rules:
#
# -  If two players play different actions, then one player beats the
#    other following the usual rule (rock beats scissors, scissors beats
#    paper, paper beats rock).
# -  If two players play the same action, the one who plays their special
#    action beats the other. If neither plays their special action, it is
#    a draw.
#
# A referee then decides the winners and the losers of that round: the
# winners receive :math:`\$1` and the losers lose :math:`\$1` (we will
# call this their *payoff* for that round).
#

######################################################################
# Naturally, the more players a given player beats, the higher the
# probability that they get a positive payoff. In particular, if we denote
# the payoff of player :math:`k` by :math:`y_k=\pm1` then
#
# .. math:: \mathbb{E}(y_k) = \frac{n^k_{\text{win}}-n^k_{\text{lose}}}{2},
#
# where :math:`n^k_{\text{win}}`, :math:`n^k_{\text{lose}}` is the number
# of players that player :math:`k` beats or loses to in that round. This
# ensures that a player is certain to get a positive (or negative) payoff
# if they beat (or lose) to everyone.
#
# To make this concrete, we will construct three 3x3 matrices ``A01``,
# ``A02``, ``A12`` which determine the rules for each pair of players.
# ``A01`` contains the expected payoff values of player 0 when playing
# against player 1. Using the rules of the game it looks as follows.
#

######################################################################
# The matrices ``A02`` and ``A12`` are defined similarly.
#

import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import pennylane as qml
import numpy as np
jax.config.update("jax_platform_name", "cpu")
np.random.seed(666) # seed used for random functions

A01 = np.array([[1, -1, 1], [1, -1, -1], [-1, 1, 0]])  # rules for player 0 vs player 1
A02 = np.array([[1, -1, 1], [1, 0, -1], [-1, 1, -1]])
A12 = np.array([[0, -1, 1], [1, 1, -1], [-1, 1, -1]])


######################################################################
# We can also define the matrices ``A10``, ``A20``, ``A21``. Since
# switching the players corresponds to taking the transpose matrix and
# a positive payoff for one player implies a negative for the other,
# these matrices are given by
# the negative of the transposed matrix:
#

A10 = -A01.T  # rules for player 1 vs player 0
A20 = -A02.T
A21 = -A12.T

######################################################################
# Note that the above game is an example of a *zero-sum game*: if player 1 beats
# player 2 then necessarily player 2 loses to player 1. This implies
# :math:`\sum_k n^k_{\text{wins}}=\sum_kn^k_{\text{lose}}` and so in every
# round we have
#
# .. math:: \mathbb{E}(y_1)+\mathbb{E}(y_2)+\mathbb{E}(y_3)=0.
#


######################################################################
# Constructing the dataset
# ------------
#


######################################################################
# Here we construct a dataset based on the above game. Our data points
# correspond to probability
# distributions over possible actions: in the  zero-sum game literature
# these are called *strategies*.
# For example, a strategy for player k is a
# vector
#
# .. math:: x_k=(P(a_k=R), P(a_k=P), P(a_k=S))
#
# where :math:`a_k` denotes player :math:`k`\ ’s action. We collect these
# into a strategy matrix X
#
# .. math::
#
#    X = \begin{pmatrix}
#        P(a_0=R) & P(a_0=P) & P(a_0=S) \\
#        P(a_1=R) & P(a_1=P) & P(a_1=S) \\
#        P(a_2=R) & P(a_2=P) & P(a_2=S) .
#        \end{pmatrix}
#
#
#

# to generate a set of strategy matrices.

        for k in range(3):
            X[i, k, :] = X[i, k, :] / norm[k]
    return X


######################################################################
# The labels in our dataset correspond to payoff values :math:`y_k` of the
# three players. Following the rules of probability we find that if the
# players use strategies :math:`x_0, x_1, x_2` the expected values of
# :math:`n_{\text{wins}}^k - n_{\text{lose}}^k` are given
# by
#
# .. math:: \mathbb{E}[n_{\text{wins}}^0 - n_{\text{lose}}^0]  = x_0 \cdot A_{01}\cdot x_1^T+x_0 \cdot A_{02}\cdot x_2^T
#
# .. math:: \mathbb{E}[n_{\text{wins}}^1 - n_{\text{lose}}^1] = x_1 \cdot A_{10}\cdot x_0^T+x_1 \cdot A_{12}\cdot x_2^T
#
# .. math:: \mathbb{E}[n_{\text{wins}}^2 - n_{\text{lose}}^2] = x_2 \cdot A_{20}\cdot x_0^T+x_2 \cdot A_{21}\cdot x_1^T
#
# Since we have seen that
# :math:`\mathbb{E}(y_k) = \frac{n^k_{\text{win}}-n^k_{\text{lose}}}{2}`
# it follows that the probability for player :math:`k` to receive a
# positive payoff given strategies :math:`X` is
#
# .. math:: P(y_k=+1\vert X) = \frac{\mathbb{E}(y_k\vert X)+1}{2} =  \frac{(\mathbb{E}[n_{\text{wins}}^k - n_{\text{lose}}^k])/2+1}{2}

# The learning problem
# --------------------
#


######################################################################
# Suppose we are given a data set :math:`\{X_i,\vec{y}_i\}` consisting of
# strategy matrices and payoff values, however we don’t know what the
# underlying game is (that is, we don’t know the players were playing the
# rock, paper scissors game described above). We do have one piece of
# information though: we know the game is zero-sum so that the data
# generation process satisfies
#
# .. math:: \mathbb{E}(y_0\vert X_i)+\mathbb{E}(y_1\vert X_i)+\mathbb{E}(y_2\vert X_i)=0.
#
# Can we learn the rock, paper scissors game from this data? More
# precisely, if we are given an unseen strategy matrix
# :math:`X_{\text{test}}` our task is to sample from the three
# distributions
#
# .. math:: P(y_0\vert X_{\text{test}}), P(y_1\vert X_{\text{test}}), P(y_2\vert X_{\text{test}}).
#
# Note we are not asking to sample from the joint distribution
# :math:`P(\vec{y}\vert X_{\text{test}})` but the three marginal
# distributions only. This can be seen as an instance of multi-task
# learning, where a single task corresponds to sampling the payoff for one
# of the three players.
#


######################################################################
# Building inductive bias into a quantum model
# --------------------------------------------
#


######################################################################
# Here we describe a simple three qubit model to tackle this problem.
# Since we know that the data satisfies the zero-sum condition, we aim to
# create a quantum model that encodes this knowledge. That is, like
# the data we want our model to satisfy
#
# .. math:: \mathbb{E}(y_0\vert X_i)+\mathbb{E}(y_1\vert X_i)+\mathbb{E}(y_2\vert X_i)=0.
#
# In machine learning, this is called encoding an *inductive
# bias* into the model, and considerations like this are often crucial for
# good generalisation performance.
#
# .. note::
#   Since the above holds for all :math:`X_i`, it implies an
#   indistinguishability of the model: if we look at one of the labels at
#   random, we are equally likely to see a positive or negative payoff
#   regardless of :math:`X_i`, and so the :math:`X_i` are indistinguishable
#   with respect to this observation. This implies a corresponding constraint
#   on non-contextual learning models, which limits their expressivity and
#   may therefore hinder their performance: see the paper for more details
#   on how this looks in practice. Luckily for us quantum theory is a
#   contextual theory, so these limitations don’t apply to our model!
#
# The quantum model we consider has the following structure:
#

##############################################################################
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/contextuality/model.png
#    :align: center
#    :width: 50%


######################################################################
# The parameters :math:`\theta` and :math:`\alpha` are trainable
# parameters of the model, and we will use the three :math:`Z`
# measurements at the end of the circuit to sample the three labels.
# Therefore, if we write the entire circuit as
# :math:`\vert \psi(\alpha,\theta,X)\rangle` the zero sum condition will
# be satisfied if
#
# .. math:: \langle \psi(\alpha,\theta,X) \vert (Z_0+Z_1+Z_2) \vert \psi(\alpha,\theta,X) \rangle = 0.
#
# Let’s see how we can create a model class that satisfies this. For
# precise details on the structure of the model, check out Figure 6 in the
# paper. We’ll first look at the parameterised unitary :math:`V_{\alpha}`,
# that we call the *input preparation unitary*. This prepares a state
# :math:`V_\alpha\vert 0 \rangle` such that
#
# .. math:: \langle 0 \vert V^\dagger_\alpha (Z_0+Z_1+Z_2) V_\alpha\vert 0 \rangle = 0.
#
# An example of such a circuit is the following.
#


def input_prep(alpha):
    # This ensures the prepared state has <Z_0+Z_1+Z_2>=0
    qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
    qml.Hadamard(wires=1)
    qml.Hadamard(wires=2)
    qml.RY(alpha[0], wires=0)
    qml.RY(alpha[0] + np.pi, wires=1)


######################################################################
# The second unitary is a *bias invariant layer*: it preserves the value
# of :math:`\langle Z_0+Z_1+Z_2 \rangle` for all input states into the
# layer. To achieve this, the generators of the unitaries in this layer
# must commute with the operator :math:`Z_0+Z_1+Z_2`. For example the
# operator :math:`X\otimes X + Y\otimes Y + Z\otimes Z` (on any pair of
# qubits) commutes with :math:`Z_0+Z_1+Z_2` and so a valid parameterised
# gate could be
#
# .. math:: e^{i\theta(X\otimes X\otimes\mathbb{I} + Y\otimes Y\otimes\mathbb{I} + Z\otimes Z\otimes\mathbb{I})}.
#
# This kind of reasoning is an example of geometric quantum machine
# learning (check out [#reptheory]_ and [#equivariant]_ or our own
# `demo <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_geometric_qml.html>`__ for an awesome introduction to the subject).

# Conclusion
# ----------
#

######################################################################
# In this demo we have constructed a dataset whose structure is
# connected to generalized contextuality, and have shown how to encode
# this structure as an inductive bias of a quantum model class. As is
# often the case, we saw that this approach outperforms a generic model
# class that does not take this knowledge into account. As a general rule,
# considerations like this should be at the front of one's mind when
# building a quantum model for a specific task.
#
# That is all for this demo. In our paper [#paper]_, it is also shown how models of
# this kind can perform better than classical surrogate
# models [#surrogates]_ at this specific task,
# which further strengthens the claim that the inductive bias of the
# quantum model is useful. For more information and to read more about the
# link between contextuality and QML, check out the full paper.

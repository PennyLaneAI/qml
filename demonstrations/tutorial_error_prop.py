Introduction
------------

In order to accurately determine the resources required to run a given quantum workflow, one must carefully track 
and propagate the sources of error within the many algorithms that make up the workflow.  

There are a variety of different errors to keep track of:

- Input / Embedding Error
- Algorithm Specific Error
- Approximation Error 
- Hardware Noise
- Measurement Uncertainty


In this demo, we show you how to use pennylane to tackle algorithm specific error and approximation error. 
Typically, these types of computations are performed by hand due to the variety of error metrics to track and 
the specific handling of such errors for each subroutine. In this demo, we present the latest tools in pennylane 
to help track algorithmic error.


Quantify Error using the Spectral Norm
--------------------------------------

One way to quantify the error of an operator is to compute the spectral norm of the difference between the approximate
operator and the true operator. We can use the new :class:`~.pennylane.resource.SpectralNormError` class to compute 
and represent this error. Consider for example, that instead of applying :code:`qml.RX(1.234)` we incure some 
*rounding* error and apply :code:`qml.RX(1.2)`; how much error would we have? 

We can compute this as follows:
"""

import pennylane as qml
from pennylane.resource import SpectralNormError

exact_op = qml.RX(1.234, wires=0)

thetas = [1.23, 1.2, 1.0]
ops = [qml.RX(theta, wires=0) for theta in thetas]

for approx_op, theta in zip(ops, thetas):
    error = SpectralNormError.get_error(exact_op, approx_op)
    print(f"Spectral Norm error (theta = {theta:.2f}): {error:.5f}")

# Tracking Errors in Hamiltonian Simulation
# -----------------------------------------
# One technique for time evolving a quantum state under a hamiltonian is to use the method of product formulas.
# The most common of which is  the Suzuki-Trotter product formula. This subroutine introduces **algorithmic error**
# as it produces an approximation to the matrix exponential operator.
#
# Let's explicitly compute the error from this algorithm for a simple hamiltonian:

time = 0.1
Hamiltonian = qml.X(0) + qml.Y(0)

exact_op = qml.exp(Hamiltonian, 1j * time)  #  U = e^iHt ~ TrotterProduct(..., order=2)
approx_op = qml.TrotterProduct(Hamiltonian, time)  #  eg: e^iHt ~ e^iXt/2 * e^iYt * e^iXt/2

error = SpectralNormError.get_error(exact_op, approx_op)  # Expensive to compute
print(f"Error from Suzuki-Trotter algorithm: {error:.5f}")


###############################################################################
# In general, computing the spectral norm is computationally expensive for larger systems as it requires
# diagonalizing the operators. For this reason, we tend to use upper bounds on the spectral norm error
# in the product formulas.
#
# We provide two common methods for bounding the error from literature [#TrotterError]_.
# They can be accessed by using :code:`op.error()` and specifying the :code:`method` keyword argument:

op = qml.TrotterProduct(
    Hamiltonian, time, n=10, order=4
)  # n, order are parameters which tune the approximation

one_norm_error_bound = op.error(method="one-norm")  # one-norm based scaling
commutator_error_bound = op.error(method="commutator")  # commutator based scaling

print("one-norm bound:   ", one_norm_error_bound)
print("commutator bound: ", commutator_error_bound)


###############################################################################
# Custom Error Operations
# -----------------------
# With the new abstract classes it's easy for anyone to define and track custom operations with error.
# All one must do, is to specify how the error is computed. Suppose, for example, that our quantum
# hardware does not natively support X-axis rotation gate :class:`~.pennylane.RX`.
#
# Notice that the sequence :math:`\hat{H} \cdot \hat{T} \cdot \hat{H}` is equivalent
# to :math:`\hat{RX}(\frac{\pi}{4}) \ ` (up to a global phase :math:`e^{i \frac{\pi}{8}}`):

from pennylane import numpy as np

op1 = qml.RX(np.pi / 4, 0)
op2 = qml.GlobalPhase(np.pi / 8) @ qml.Hadamard(0) @ qml.T(0) @ qml.Hadamard(0)

np.allclose(qml.matrix(op1), qml.matrix(op2))


###############################################################################
# We can approximate the RX gate by *rounding* the rotation angle to the lowest multiple
# of :math:`\frac{\pi}{4}`, then using multiple iterations of the sequence above.
#
# The *approximation* error we incure from this decomposition is given by the expression:
#
# ..math::
#
#   \epsilon = \sqrt{2 - 2 * sin(\theta)}
#
# Where :math:`\theta = \frac{\pi \ - \ \Delta_{\phi}}{2}` and :math:`\Delta_{\phi}` is the
# absolute difference between the true rotation angle and the next lowest mulitple of :math:`\frac{\pi}{4}`.
#
# We can take this approximate decomposition and turn it into a PennyLane operation simply by inheriting
# from the :class:`~.pennylane.resource.ErrorOperation` class, and defining the error method:

from pennylane.resource.error import ErrorOperation


class Approximate_RX(ErrorOperation):

    def __init__(self, phi, wires):
        """Approximate decomposition for RX gate"""
        return super().__init__(phi, wires)

    @staticmethod
    def compute_decomposition(phi, wires):
        """Defining the gate decomposition"""
        num_iterations = int(phi // (np.pi / 4))  # how many rotations of pi/4 to apply
        global_phase = num_iterations * np.pi / 8

        decomposition = [qml.GlobalPhase(global_phase)]
        for _ in range(num_iterations):
            decomposition += [qml.Hadamard(0), qml.T(0), qml.Hadamard(0)]

        return decomposition

    def error(self):
        """The error in our approximation"""
        phi = self.parameters[0]  # The error depends on the true rotation angle
        delta_phi = phi % (np.pi / 4)

        theta = (np.pi - delta_phi) / 2
        error = np.sqrt(2 - 2 * np.sin(theta))
        return SpectralNormError(error)


###############################################################################
# We can verify that evaluating the expression for the approximation error gives us the same result as
# explicitly computing the error. Notice that we can access the error of our new operator in the same way
# we did for hamiltonian simulation, using :func:`op.error()`.

phi = 1.23
true_op = qml.RX(phi, wires=0)
approx_op = Approximate_RX(phi, wires=0)

error_from_theory = approx_op.error()
explicit_comp = SpectralNormError.get_error(true_op, approx_op)

print("Explicit computation: ", explicit_comp)
print("Error from function: ", error_from_theory)

###############################################################################
# Bringing it All Together
# ------------------------
# Tracking the error for each of these components individually is great, but we ultimately want to put these
# pieces together in a quantum circuit. Pennylane now automatically tracks and propagates these errors through
# the circuit. This means we can write our circuits as usual and get all the benefits of error tracking for free.

dev = qml.device("default.qubit")


@qml.qnode(dev)
def circ(H, t, phi1, phi2):
    qml.Hadamard(0)
    qml.Hadamard(1)

    # Approx decomposition
    Approximate_RX(phi1, 0)
    Approximate_RX(phi2, 1)

    qml.CNOT([0, 1])

    # Approx Time evolution:
    qml.TrotterProduct(H, t, order=2)

    # Measurement:
    return qml.state()


###############################################################################
# Along with executing the circuit, we can also compute the error in the circuit through :func:`qml.specs()`:

phi1, phi2 = (phi + 0.12, phi - 3.45)
print("State:")
print(circ(Hamiltonian, time, phi1, phi2), "\n")

errors_dict = qml.specs(circ)(Hamiltonian, time, phi1, phi2)["errors"]
error = errors_dict["SpectralNormError"]
print("Error:")
print(error)

# Conclusion
# ----------
# In this demo, we showcased the new :class:`~.pennylane.resource.SpectralNormError` and
# :class:`~.pennylane.resource.ErrorOperation` classes in PennyLane. We highlighted the new functionality
# in :class:`~.pennylane.TrotterProduct` class to compute error bounds in product formulas.
# We explained how to construct a custom error operation. We used this in a simple circuit to track and
# propagate the error through the circuit. We hope that you can make use of these
# tools in cutting edge research workflows to track errors.

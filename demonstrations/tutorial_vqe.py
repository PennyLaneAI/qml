The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) :ref:`[1, 2]<vqe_references>` is a flagship algorithm for
quantum chemistry using near-term quantum computers. VQE is an application of the `Ritz variational
principle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritz_method>`_  where a quantum computer is used to
prepare a wave function ansatz of the molecule and estimate the expectation value of its electronic
Hamiltonian while a classical optimizer is used to adjust the quantum circuit parameters in order
to find the molecule's ground state energy.

For example, if we use a minimal basis, the ground state wave function of the hydrogen molecule
:math:`\vert \Psi \rangle = \alpha \vert 1100 \rangle + \beta \vert 0011 \rangle` consists of only
the Hartree-Fock component and a doubly-excited configuration where the two electrons occupy the
highest-energy molecular orbitals. If we use a quantum computer to prepare the four-qubit
entangled state :math:`\vert \Psi \rangle`, the ultimate goal of the VQE algorithm
is to find the values of :math:`\alpha` and :math:`\beta` that minimize the expectation value of
the electronic Hamiltonian.

The PennyLane library allows users to implement the full VQE algorithm using only a few
lines of code. In this tutorial, we guide you through a calculation of the ground-state energy of
the hydrogen molecule. Let's get started! ‚öõÔ∏è

Building the electronic Hamiltonian
-----------------------------------

The first step is to import the required libraries and packages:
"""

import pennylane as qml
from pennylane import numpy as np

##############################################################################
# The second step is to specify the molecule whose properties we aim to calculate.
# This is done by providing three pieces of information: the geometry and charge of the molecule,
# and the spin multiplicity of the electronic configuration.
#
# The geometry of a molecule is given by the three-dimensional coordinates and symbols of all
# its atomic species. There are several databases such as `the NIST Chemistry
# WebBook <https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/name-ser/>`_, `ChemSpider <http://www.chemspider.com/>`_
# and `SMART-SNS <http://smart.sns.it/molecules/>`_ that provide
# geometrical data for a large number of molecules. Here, we make use of a locally saved file in
# ``.xyz`` format that contains the geometry of the hydrogen molecule, and specify its name for
# later use:

geometry = 'h2.xyz'

##############################################################################
# Alternatively, you can download the file here: :download:`h2.xyz </demonstrations/h2.xyz>`.
#
# The charge determines the number of electrons that have been added or removed compared to the
# neutral molecule. In this example, as is the case in many quantum chemistry simulations,
# we will consider a neutral molecule:

charge = 0

##############################################################################
# It is also important to define how the electrons occupy the molecular orbitals to be optimized
# within the `Hartree-Fock approximation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartree-Fock_method>`__.
# This is captured by the `multiplicity <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicity_(chemistry)>`_
# parameter, which is related to the number of unpaired electrons in the Hartree-Fock state. For
# the neutral hydrogen molecule, the multiplicity is one:

multiplicity = 1

##############################################################################
# Finally, we need to specify the `basis set <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_set_(
# chemistry)>`_ used to approximate atomic orbitals. This is typically achieved by using a linear
# combination of Gaussian functions. In this example, we will use the minimal basis STO-3g where a
# set of 3 Gaussian functions are contracted to represent an atomic Slater-type orbital (STO):

basis_set = 'sto-3g'

##############################################################################
# At this stage, to compute the molecule's Hamiltonian in the Pauli basis, several
# calculations need to be performed. With PennyLane, these can all be done in a
# single line by calling the function :func:`~.generate_hamiltonian`. The first input to
# the function is a string denoting the name of the molecule, which will determine the name given
# to the saved files that are produced during the calculations:

name = 'h2'

##############################################################################
# The geometry, charge, multiplicity, and basis set must also be specified as input. Finally,
# the number of active electrons and active orbitals have to be indicated, as well as the
# fermionic-to-qubit mapping, which can be either Jordan-Wigner (``jordan_wigner``) or Bravyi-Kitaev
# (``bravyi_kitaev``). The outputs of the function are the qubit Hamiltonian of the molecule and the
# number of qubits needed to represent it:

h, nr_qubits = qml.qchem.generate_hamiltonian(
    name,
    geometry,
    charge,
    multiplicity,
    basis_set,
    n_active_electrons=2,
    n_active_orbitals=2,
    mapping='jordan_wigner'
)

print('Number of qubits = ', nr_qubits)
print('Hamiltonian is ', h)

##############################################################################
# That's it! From here on, we can use PennyLane as usual, employing its entire stack of
# algorithms and optimizers.
#
# Implementing the VQE algorithm
# ------------------------------
#
# PennyLane contains the :class:`~.VQECost` class, specifically
# built to implement the VQE algorithm. We begin by defining the device, in this case a simple
# qubit simulator:

dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=nr_qubits)

##############################################################################
# In VQE, the goal is to train a quantum circuit to prepare the ground state of the input
# Hamiltonian. This requires a clever choice of circuit, which should be complex enough to
# prepare the ground state, but also sufficiently easy to optimize. In this example, we employ a
# variational circuit that is capable of preparing the normalized states of the form
# :math:`\alpha|1100\rangle + \beta|0011\rangle` which encode the ground state wave function of
# the hydrogen molecule described with a minimal basis set. The circuit consists of single-qubit
# rotations on all wires, followed by three entangling CNOT gates, as shown in the figure below:
#

#
# .. figure:: /demonstrations/variational_quantum_eigensolver/sketch_circuit.png
#     :width: 50%
#     :align: center
#
# |
#

##############################################################################
# In the circuit, we apply single-qubit rotations, followed by CNOT gates:


def circuit(params, wires):
    qml.BasisState(np.array([1, 1, 0, 0]), wires=wires)
    for i in wires:
        qml.Rot(*params[i], wires=i)
    qml.CNOT(wires=[2, 3])
    qml.CNOT(wires=[2, 0])
    qml.CNOT(wires=[3, 1])

##############################################################################
# .. note::
#
#     The qubit register has been initialized to :math:`|1100\rangle` which encodes the
#     Hartree-Fock state of the hydrogen molecule described with a `minimal basis
#     <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_set_(chemistry)#Minimal_basis_sets>`__.
#
# The cost function for optimizing the circuit can be created using the :class:`~.VQECost`
# class, which is tailored for VQE optimization. It requires specifying the
# circuit, target Hamiltonian, and the device, and returns a cost function that can
# be evaluated with the circuit parameters:


cost_fn = qml.VQECost(circuit, h, dev)


##############################################################################
# Wrapping up, we fix an optimizer and randomly initialize circuit parameters. For reliable
# results, we fix the seed of the random number generator, since in practice it may be necessary
# to re-initialize the circuit several times before convergence occurs.

opt = qml.GradientDescentOptimizer(stepsize=0.4)
np.random.seed(0)
params = np.random.normal(0, np.pi, (nr_qubits, 3))

print(params)

##############################################################################
# We carry out the optimization over a maximum of 200 steps, aiming to reach a convergence
# tolerance (difference in cost function for subsequent optimization steps) of :math:`\sim 10^{
# -6}`.

max_iterations = 200
conv_tol = 1e-06

prev_energy = cost_fn(params)
for n in range(max_iterations):
    params = opt.step(cost_fn, params)
    energy = cost_fn(params)
    conv = np.abs(energy - prev_energy)

    if n % 20 == 0:
        print('Iteration = {:},  Ground-state energy = {:.8f} Ha,  Convergence parameter = {'
              ':.8f} Ha'.format(n, energy, conv))

    if conv <= conv_tol:
        break

    prev_energy = energy

print()
print('Final convergence parameter = {:.8f} Ha'.format(conv))
print('Final value of the ground-state energy = {:.8f} Ha'.format(energy))
print('Accuracy with respect to the FCI energy: {:.8f} Ha ({:.8f} kcal/mol)'.
        format(np.abs(energy - (-1.136189454088)), np.abs(energy - (-1.136189454088))*627.503))
print()
print('Final circuit parameters = \n', params)

##############################################################################
# Success! üéâüéâüéâ The ground-state energy of the hydrogen molecule has been estimated with chemical
# accuracy (< 1 kcal/mol) with respect to the exact value of -1.136189454088 Hartree (Ha) obtained
# from a full configuration-interaction (FCI) calculation. This is because, for the optimized
# values of the single-qubit rotation angles, the state prepared by the VQE ansatz is precisely
# the FCI ground-state of the :math:`H_2` molecule :math:`|H_2\rangle_{gs} = 0.99 |1100\rangle - 0.10
# |0011\rangle`.

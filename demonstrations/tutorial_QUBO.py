r"""Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)
======================================================


Solving combinatorial optimization problems using quantum computing is one of those promising
applications for the near term. But, why are combinatorial optimization problems even important?
We care about them because, in fields such as logistics, finance, and engineering, there exist useful applications that can be translated into combinatorial optimization problems. But
useful applications are not enough to justify the use of quantum devices. It is here where the second ingredient comes in—many
combinatorial optimization problems are difficult to solve!  Finding good solutions (classically)
for large instances of them requires an enormous amount of computational resources and time 😮‍💨.

In this demo, we will be using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum
annealing (QA) to solve a combinatorial optimization problem. First, we show how to translate
combinatorial optimization problems into the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO)
formulation. In the first part of this notebook, we will show how to encode the Knapsack problem as
a target Hamiltonian and solve it using the optimization-free version of QAOA and QA on D-Wave
Advantage quantum annealer.

# Combinatorial Optimization Problems
# -----------------------------------------
#
# Combinatorial optimization problems involve finding the
# best way to arrange a set of objects or values to achieve a specific goal. The word ‘combinatorial’
# refers to the fact that we are dealing with combinations of objects, while ‘optimization’ means
# that we are trying to find the best possible arrangement of them.
#
# Let’s start with a basic example. Imagine we have 5 items ⚽️, 💻, 📸, 📚, and 🎸 and we would love
# to bring all of them with us. Unfortunately, our knapsack does not fit
# all of them 😔. So we need to find the best way to bring the most important items with us.
#
# This is an example of the infamous *Knapsack Problem.* From our problem statement, we know
# that we need to maximize the value of the most important items. So we need to assign a value based
# on the importance the items have to us:
#

items_values = {"⚽️": 8, "💻": 47, "📸": 10, "📚": 5, "🎸": 16}
values_list = [8, 47, 10, 5, 16]

######################################################################
# Additionally, we know that we the knapsack has limited space. For simplicity, let’s assume
# there is a limit to the weight it can hold. So we need to assign an estimate of the weight of each
# item:
#

items_weight = {"⚽️": 3, "💻": 11, "📸": 14, "📚": 19, "🎸": 5}
weights_list = [3, 11, 14, 19, 5]

######################################################################
# Finally, we need to know the maximum weight we can bring in the knapsack:
#

maximum_weight = 26

######################################################################
# Now we have well-defined optimization problem to work with. Let’s start with the easiest way to solve it, i.e.,
# by trying all possible combinations of the items. But the number of combinations is equal to :math:`2^n` where :math:`n`
# is the number of items. Why is this the case? For each item, we have two options—“1”
# if we bring the item and “0” otherwise. With 2 options for each item and 5 items to choose from, we have
# :math:`2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 2^5 = 32` combinations in our case. For each of these cases, we calculate the sum
# of the values and the sum of the weights, selecting the one that fulfills the maximum weight constraint and
# has the largest sum of values (this is the optimization step).
# Now, let's write some code to solve the Knapsack problem with this brute-force method!

# Guess we don’t have the time to try all the possible solutions for 100 items 😅! Thankfully,
# we don't need to — there are algorithms to find good solutions to combinatorial
# optimization problems, and maybe one day we will show that one of these algorithms is quantum. So
# let’s continue with our quest 🫡.
#
# Our next step is to represent our problem mathematically. First, we represent our items by binary
# variables :math:`x_i` that take the value :math:`1` if we bring the :math:`i`-th item and :math:`0` otherwise. Next, we know that we want to **maximize**
# the value of the items carried, so let’s create a function :math:`f(\mathrm{x})` with these
# characteristics. To do so, we assign the variables :math:`x_i` to each of the items
# :math:`\mathrm{x} = \{x_0:⚽️ , x_1:💻, x_2:📸, x_3:📚, x_4:🎸\},` multiply each variable by the corresponding item value, and define a function that calculates the weighted sum
# value of the item:
#
# .. math:: \max_x f(\mathrm{x}) = \max_x \left(8x_0 + 47x_1 + 10x_2 + 5x_3 + 16x_4\right) \tag{1}
#
# This function, called the ``objective function``, represents the value of the items we can
# transport. Usually, solvers `minimize functions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization>`__, so a simple trick in our case is to minimize the
# negative of our function (which ends up being maximizing our original function 🤪)
#
# .. math:: \min_x -(8x_0 + 47x_1 + 10x_2 + 5x_3 + 16x_4 ) \tag{2}
#
# We can write our equation above using the general form of the `QUBO
# representation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_unconstrained_binary_optimization>`__, i.e.,
# using an upper triangular matrix :math:`Q \in \mathbb{R}^{n \  \mathrm{x} \ n}:`
#
# .. math:: \min_x \mathrm{x}^TQ \mathrm{x} = \min_x \left(\sum_i \sum_{j\ge i} Q_{ij} x_i x_j\right) = \min_x \left(\sum_i Q_{ii} x_i + \sum_i\sum_{j>i} Q_{ij}x_i x_j\right) \tag{3}
#
# where :math:`\mathrm{x}` is a vector representing the items of our problem. Note that
# :math:`x_i x_i = x_i` for binary variables. Let's look at an example of how to calculate the :math:`\mathrm{x}^TQ \mathrm{x}` above:
#

Q = -np.diag(list(items_values.values()))  # Matrix Q for the problem above.
x_opt = np.array(
    [[1 if i in optimal_solution["items"] else 0] for i in items_values.keys()]
)  # Optimal solution.
opt_str = "".join(str(i[0]) for i in x_opt)
min_cost = (x_opt.T @ Q @ x_opt)[0, 0]  # using Equation 3 above
print(f"Q={Q}")
print(f"The minimum cost is  {min_cost}")

######################################################################
# But just with this function, we cannot solve the problem. We also need the weight restriction. Based
# on our variables, the weight list (items_weight = {“⚽️”: :math:`3`, “💻”: :math:`11`, “📸”: :math:`14`, “📚”: :math:`19,` “🎸”: :math:`5`}), and
# the knapsack maximum weight (maximum_weight :math:`W = 26`), we can construct our constraint
#
# .. math:: 3x_0 + 11x_1 + 14x_2 + 19x_3 + 5x_4 \le 26
#
# Here comes a crucial step in the solution of the problem: we need to find a way to combine our
# *objective function* with this *inequality constraint*. One common method is to include the
# constraint as a **penalty** term in the objective function. This penalty term should be
# zero when the total weight of the items is less or equal to 26 and large otherwise. So to make them
# zero in the range of validity of the constraint, the usual approach is to use *slack variables*.
# There is an alternative method that has shown to perform better, called
# `unbalanced penalization <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.13914.pdf>`_ , but we present this method
# later 😉.
#
# The slack variable is an auxiliary variable that allows us to convert inequality constraints into equality
# constraints. The slack variable :math:`S` represents the amount by which the left-hand side of the
# inequality falls short of the right-hand side. If the left-hand side is less than the right-hand
# side, then :math:`S` will be positive and equal to the difference between the two sides. In our case
#
# .. math:: 3x_0 + 11x_1 + 14x_2 + 19x_3 + 5x_4 + S = 26\tag{4}
#
# where :math:`0 \le S \le 26.` But let’s take this slowly because we can get lost here, so let’s see
# this with some examples:
#
# -  Imagine this case. No item is selected {:math:`x_0`: :math:`0`, :math:`x_1`: :math:`0`, :math:`x_2:` :math:`0,`
#    :math:`x_3`: :math:`0,` :math:`x_4:` :math:`0`}, so the overall weight is zero (a valid solution) and the equality
#    constraint Eq.(4) must be fulfilled. So we select our slack variable to be 26.
#
# -  Now, what if we bring ⚽️ and 📚 {:math:`x_0`: :math:`1`, :math:`x_1`: :math:`0`, :math:`x_2`: :math:`0`, :math:`x_3:` :math:`1,`
#    :math:`x_4:`0}. In this case, the overall weight is :math:`3 + 19 = 22` (a valid solution) and the equality
#    constraint is fulfilled if :math:`22 + S = 26 \rightarrow S = 4.`
#
# -  Finally, what if we try to bring all the items {:math:`x_0`: :math:`1`, :math:`x_1`: :math:`1`, :math:`x_2:` :math:`1,`
#    :math:`x_3`: :math:`1,` :math:`x_4:` :math:`1`}, the total weight, in this case, is :math:`3+11+14+19+5=52` (not a valid
#    solution), to fulfill the constraint, we need :math:`52 + S = 26 \rightarrow S=-26` but the slack
#    variable is in the range :math:`(0,26)` in our definition, so, in this case, there is valid solution for :math:`S.`
#
# Excellent, now we have a way to represent the inequality constraint. Two further steps are needed.
# First, the slack variable has to be represented in binary form so we can cast it as a sum
#
# .. math:: S = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} 2^k s_k,
#
# where :math:`N = \lfloor\log_2(\max S)\rfloor + 1.` In our case
# :math:`N = \lfloor\log_2(26)\rfloor + 1 = 5.` We need 5 binary variables to represent the range
# of our :math:`S` variable.
#
# .. math:: S = 2^0 s_0 + 2^1 s_1 + 2^2 s_2 + 2^3 s_3 + 2^4 s_4
#
# To compact our equation later, let’s rename our slack variables by :math:`s_0=x_5`, :math:`s_1=x_6,`
# :math:`s_3=x_7`, :math:`s_4=x_8,` and :math:`s_5=x_9.` Then we have
#
# .. math::  S = 1 x_5 + 2 x_6 + 4 x_7 + 8 x_8 + 16 x_9.
#
# For example, if we need to represent the second case above (⚽️, 📚),
# :math:`S = 4 \rightarrow\{x_5:0, x_6:0,x_7:1,x_8:0, x_9:0\}.`
#
# We are almost done in our quest to represent our problem in such a way that our quantum computer can
# manage it. The last step is to add the penalty term, a usual choice for it is to use a
# quadratic penalty
#
# .. math:: p(x,s) = \lambda \left(3x_0 + 11x_1 + 14x_2 + 19 x_3 + 5x_4 + x_5 + 2 x_6 + 4x_7 + 8 x_8 + 16 x_9 - 26\right)^2. \tag{5}
#
# Note that this is simply the difference between the left- and right-hand sides of equation :math:`(4).` With this
# expression, the condition is satisfied only when the term inside the parentheses is zero.
# :math:`\lambda` is a penalty coefficient that we must tune to make that the constraint will always
# be fulfilled.
#
# Now, the objective function can be given by:
#
# .. math:: \min_{x,s} f(x) + p(x,s) = \min_{x,s} -(8x_0 + 47x_1 + 10x_2 + 5x_3 + 16x_4) +
# .. math:: \lambda \left(3x_0 + 11x_1 + 14x_2 + 19x_3 + 5x_4 + x_5 + 2 x_6 + 4x_7 + 8 x_8 + 16 x_9 - 26\right)^2 \tag{6}
#
# or, compacted,
#
# .. math:: \min_{x,s} \left(f(x) + p(x,s) = -\sum_i v_i x_i +\lambda \left(\sum_i w_i x_i - W\right)^2\right), \tag{7}
#
# where :math:`v_i` and :math:`w_i` are the value and weight of the :math:`i`-th item. Because of
# the square in the second term, some :math:`x_i x_i` terms show up. We can apply the property
# :math:`x_i x_i = x_i` (if :math:`x_i = 0 \rightarrow x_ix_i = 0\cdot0 = 0` or
# :math:`x_i = 1 \rightarrow x_ix_i = 1\cdot1 = 1`).
#
# The quadratic  term on the right-hand side of equation :math:`(7)` can be rewritten as
#
# .. math:: \left(\sum_i w_i x_i - C\right)^2 = \left(\sum_i w_i x_i - C\right)\left(\sum_j w_j x_j - C\right)
# .. math::                                   = \sum_i \sum_j w_i w_j x_i x_j - 2C \sum_i w_i x_i + C^2
# .. math::                                   = 2\sum_i \sum_{j>i} w_i w_j x_i x_j - \sum_i w_i(2C - w_i) x_i + C^2 \tag{8}
#
# where :math:`w_i` represent the weights for the items and :math:`2^k` for the slack variables. We
# can combine equations :math:`(7)` and :math:`(8)` to get the terms of the matrix :math:`Q.` So we end up with
#
# .. math:: Q_{ij} = 2\lambda w_i w_j,\tag{9}
#
# .. math:: Q_{ii} = - v_i  + \lambda w_i(w_i - 2W).\tag{10}
#
# The term :math:`\lambda W^2` is only an offset value that does not affect the optimization result
# and can be added after the optimization to represent the right cost. Let's see how it looks 
# like in our particular example.
#

N = round(np.ceil(np.log2(maximum_weight)))  # number of slack variables
weights = list(items_weight.values()) + [2**k for k in range(N)]

QT = np.pad(Q, ((0, N), (0, N)))  # adding the extra slack variables at the end of the Q matrix
n_qubits = len(QT)
lambd = 2  # We choose a lambda parameter enough large for the constraint to always be fulfilled
# Adding the terms for the penalty term
for i in range(len(QT)):
    QT[i, i] += lambd * weights[i] * (weights[i] - 2 * maximum_weight)  # Eq. 10
    for j in range(i + 1, len(QT)):
        QT[i, j] += 2 * lambd * weights[i] * weights[j]  # Eq. 9
offset = lambd * maximum_weight**2
print(f"Q={QT}")
# optimal string slack string
slack_string = np.binary_repr(maximum_weight - optimal_solution["weight"], N)[::-1]
x_opt_slack = np.concatenate(
    (x_opt, np.array([[int(i)] for i in slack_string]))

cost = (x_opt_slack.T @ QT @ x_opt_slack)[0, 0] + offset  # Optimal cost using equation 3
print(f"Cost:{cost}")

# At this point, we have encoded the problem in a format that we can use to solve it on quantum

# QAOA
# -------
#
# We use QAOA `[1] <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4028.pdf>`__ to find the solution to our Knapsack
# Problem (`read this demo <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qaoa_intro>`__ for a more detailed explanation
# of the QAOA algorithm). In this case, the cost Hamiltonian, :math:`H_c(Z),` obtained from the QUBO
# formulation is translated into a parametric unitary gate given by

#
#        U(H_c, \gamma_i)=e^{-i \gamma_i H_c},\tag{11}
#

#
# where :math:`\gamma_i \in {1,..., p}` is a set of :math:`p` parameters to be optimized, the term
# :math:`e^{-i\gamma_i J_{ij}Z_iZ_j}` is implemented in a quantum circuit using a
# :math:`RZZ(2\gamma_iJ_{ij})` gate, and :math:`e^{-i\gamma_i h_iZ_i}` using a :math:`RZ(2\gamma_ih_i)`
# gate.
#
# The mixer operator applied is
#
# .. math::
#
#
#        U(B, \beta_i)=e^{i \beta_i X},\tag{12}
#
# where :math:`\beta_i` is the second parameter that must be optimized and

# :math:`p.` We can adopt this principle and initialize the :math:`\beta_i` and :math:`\gamma_i` in
# this way, moving :math:`\beta_i` from :math:`1` to :math:`0` and :math:`\gamma_i` from :math:`0` to :math:`1.` With this approach,

# I know this is a lot of information so far, but we are almost done! The last step to represent the
# QUBO problem on QPUs is to change the :math:`x_i\in \{0, 1\}` variables to spin variables
# :math:`z_i \in \{1, -1\}` via the transformation :math:`x_i = (1 - z_i) / 2.` We also want to set
# the penalty term, so a value of :math:`\lambda = 2` will be enough for our problem. In
# practice, we choose a value for :math:`\lambda` and, if after the optimization the solution does not
# fulfill the constraints, we try again using a larger value. On the other hand, if the solution is suspected
# to be a valid but suboptimal, then we will reduce :math:`\lambda` a little. Eq.(3) can be
# represented by an Ising Hamiltonian with quadratic and linear terms plus a constant :math:`O,` namely
#
# .. math::
#
#

# As you can see, only a few samples from the 5000 shots give us the right answer, there are only
# :math:`2^5 = 32` options. Randomly guessing the solution will give us on average :math:`5000/32 \approx 156`
# optimal solutions. Why don’t we get good results using QAOA? Maybe we can blame the algorithm
# or we look deeper— it turns out our encoding method is really bad. Randomly guessing using the whole set of
# variables (:math:`5` items + :math:`5` slack) :math:`2^{10} = 1024` options, :math:`5000/1024 \approx 5.` So in fact we have a

# Unbalanced penalization (An alternative to slack variables)
# -----------------------------------------------------------
#
# Unbalanced penalization is a function characterized by a larger penalty when the inequality
# constraint is not achieved than when it is. So we have to modify Eq. 7 to include a linear term in
# the following way:
#
# .. math:: \min_{x,s} \left(f(x) + p(x,s)\right) = \min_{x,s} \left(-\sum_i v_i x_i - \lambda_1 \left(\sum_i w_i x_i - W\right) + \lambda_2 \left(\sum_i w_i x_i - W\right)^2\right)\tag{14}.
#
# where :math:`\lambda_{1,2}` are again penalty coefficients. Here `[2] <https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13914>`__ and `[3] <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18757.pdf>`__ some details about unbalanced penalization. 
# The method is already implemented in `OpenQAOA <https://openqaoa.entropicalabs.com/>`__ and `D-Wave Ocean <https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/>`__ so we don't have to code it ourselves. **The cliffnotes are
# that you don’t need slack variables for the inequality constraints anymore using this approach**.

# Conclusion
# ------------
#
# We have come to the end of this demo. We have covered the definition of combinatorial optimization problems
# and how to formulate one of them, the Knapsack Problem, using QUBO, and two different encodings: slack
# variables and unbalanced penalization. Then, we solved them using optimization-free QAOA and QA. Now,
# it’s your turn to experiment with QAOA! If you need some inspiration:
#
# -  Look at the `OpenQAOA <https://openqaoa.entropicalabs.com/>`__ set of problems. There are plenty of them like bin packing,
#    traveling salesman, and maximal independent set, among others.
#
# -  Play around with larger problems.

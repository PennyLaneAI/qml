*Author: PennyLane dev team. Posted: 3 Feb 2021. Last updated: 3 Feb 2021.*

Over the last few years, quantum machine learning research has provided a lot of insights on 
how we can understand and train quantum circuits as machine learning models. 
While many connections to neural networks have been made, it becomes increasingly clear that 
their mathematical foundation is intimately related to so-called *kernel methods*, the most famous 
of which is the `support vector machine (SVM) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine>`__ 
(see for example `Schuld and Killoran (2018) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07128>`__, 
`Havlicek et al. (2018) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11326>`__,
`Liu et al. (2020) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02174>`__, 
`Huang et al. (2020) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01938>`__,
and, for a systematic summary which we will follow here, 
`Schuld (2021) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11020>`__). 

The link between quantum models and kernel methods has important practical implications: 
we can replace the common `variational approach <https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/variational_circuit.html>`__ 
to quantum machine learning with a classical kernel method where the kernel—a small building block 
of the overall algorithm—is computed by a quantum device. In many situations there are 
guarantees that we get better or at least equally good results. 

This demonstration explores how kernel-based training compares with 
`variational training <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_variational_classifier.html>`__ in terms of the number of quantum 
circuits that have to be evaluated. For this we train a quantum machine
learning model with a kernel-based approach using a combination of PennyLane
and the `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/>`__ machine
learning library. We compare this strategy with a variational
quantum circuit trained via stochastic gradient descent using
`PyTorch <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/interfaces/torch.html>`__.

We will see that in a typical small-scale example, kernel-based training requires only a fraction of the number of 
quantum circuit evaluations used by variational circuit training, while each 
evaluation runs a much shorter circuit.  
In general, the relative efficiency of kernel-based methods compared to variational circuits 
depends on the number of parameters used in the variational model.

       :align: center
       :scale: 100%
       :alt: Scaling of kernel-based vs. variational learning

If the number of variational parameters remains small, e.g., there is a square-root-like scaling with the number 
of data samples (green line), variational circuits are almost as efficient as neural networks (blue line), 
and require much fewer circuit evaluations 
than the quadratic scaling of kernel methods (red line). 
However, with current hardware-compatible training strategies, 
kernel methods scale much better than variational circuits that require a number of parameters of the 
order of the training set size (orange line). 

In conclusion, **for quantum machine learning applications with many parameters, kernel-based training can be a great 
alternative to the variational approach to quantum machine learning**.

After working through this demo, you will:

* be able to use a support vector machine with a quantum kernel computed with PennyLane, and

* be able to compare the scaling of quantum circuit evaluations required in kernel-based versus 
  variational training.

# Background
# ----------
#
# Let us consider a *quantum model* of the form
#
# .. math:: f(x) = \langle \phi(x) | \mathcal{M} | \phi(x)\rangle,
#
# where :math:`| \phi(x)\rangle` is prepared
# by a fixed `embedding
# circuit <https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/quantum_embedding.html>`__ that 
# encodes data inputs :math:`x`,
# and :math:`\mathcal{M}` is an arbitrary observable. This model includes variational 
# quantum machine learning models, since the observable can
# effectively be implemented by a simple measurement that is preceded by a
# variational circuit: 
#
#
# .. figure:: ../demonstrations/kernel_based_training/quantum_model.png 
#       :align: center
#       :scale: 20%
#       :alt: quantum-model
#
# |
# 
# For example, applying a circuit :math:`G(\theta)` and then
# measuring the Pauli-Z observable :math:`\sigma^0_z` of the first qubit
# implements the trainable measurement 
# :math:`\mathcal{M}(\theta) = G^{\dagger}(\theta) \sigma^0_z G(\theta)`.
#
# The main practical consequence of approaching quantum machine learning with a 
# kernel approach is that instead of training :math:`f` variationally,
# we can often train an equivalent classical kernel method with a kernel executed on a
# quantum device. This *quantum kernel*
# is given by the mutual overlap of two data-encoding quantum states,
#
# .. math::  \kappa(x, x') = | \langle \phi(x') | \phi(x)\rangle|^2.
#
# Kernel-based training therefore bypasses the processing and measurement 
# parts of common variational circuits, and only depends on the
# data encoding.
#
# If the loss function :math:`L` is the `hinge
# loss <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinge_loss>`__, the kernel method
# corresponds to a standard `support vector
# machine <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine>`__ (SVM)
# in the sense of a maximum-margin classifier. Other convex loss functions
# lead to more general variations of support vector machines.
#
# .. note::
#
#    More precisely, we can replace variational with kernel-based 
#    training if the optimisation
#    problem can be written as minimizing a cost of the form
# 
#    .. math::  \min_f  \lambda\;  \mathrm{tr}\{\mathcal{M}^2\} + \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^M L(f(x^m), y^m), 
#
#    which is a regularized empirical risk with training data samples :math:`(x^m, y^m)_{m=1\dots M}`, 
#    regularization strength :math:`\lambda \in \mathbb{R}`, and loss function :math:`L`.
#
#    Theory predicts that kernel-based training will always find better or equally good
#    minima of this risk. However, to show this here we would have
#    to either regularize the variational training by the trace of the squared observable, or switch off
#    regularization in the classical SVM, which removes a lot of its strength. The kernel-based and the variational 
#    training in this demonstration therefore optimize slightly different cost
#    functions, and it is out of our scope to establish whether one training method finds a better minimum than
#    the other.

# Kernel-based training
# ---------------------
#
# First, we will turn to kernel-based training of quantum models. 
# As stated above, an example implementation is a standard support vector 
# machine with a kernel computed by a quantum circuit.
# 


######################################################################
# We begin by importing all sorts of useful methods:
#

import numpy as np
import torch
from torch.nn.functional import relu

from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

import pennylane as qml
from pennylane.templates import AngleEmbedding, StronglyEntanglingLayers
from pennylane.operation import Tensor

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

np.random.seed(42)


######################################################################
# The second step is to define a data set. Since the performance  
# of the models is not the focus of this demo, we can just use 
# the first two classes of the famous `Iris data set <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set>`__. 
# Dating back to as far as 1936, 
# this toy data set consists of 100 samples of four features each, 
# and gives rise to a very simple classification problem.
#

X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True) 

# pick inputs and labels from the first two classes only,
# corresponding to the first 100 samples
X = X[:100]
y = y[:100]

# scaling the inputs is important since the embedding we use is periodic
scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X)
X_scaled = scaler.transform(X)

# scaling the labels to -1, 1 is important for the SVM and the
# definition of a hinge loss
y_scaled = 2 * (y - 0.5)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y_scaled)


######################################################################
# We use the `angle-embedding
# template <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.templates.embeddings.AngleEmbedding.html>`__
# which needs as many qubits as there are features:
#

n_qubits = len(X_train[0])
n_qubits


######################################################################
# To implement the kernel we could prepare the two states :math:`| \phi(x) \rangle`, :math:`| \phi(x') \rangle`
# on different sets of qubits with angle-embedding routines :math:`S(x), S(x')`,
# and measure their overlap with a small routine called a `SWAP test <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap_test>`__.
#
# However, we need only half the number of qubits if we prepare
# :math:`| \phi(x)\rangle` and then apply the inverse embedding
# with :math:`x'` on the same qubits. We then measure the projector onto
# the initial state :math:`|0..0\rangle \langle 0..0|`.

#       :align: center
#       :scale: 80% 
#       :alt: Kernel evaluation circuit
#
# To verify that this gives us the kernel:
#
# .. math::
#
#      \begin{align*}
#          \langle 0..0 |S(x') S(x)^{\dagger} \mathcal{M} S(x')^{\dagger} S(x)  | 0..0\rangle &= \langle 0..0 |S(x') S(x)^{\dagger} |0..0\rangle \langle 0..0| S(x')^{\dagger} S(x)  | 0..0\rangle  \\
#          &= |\langle 0..0| S(x')^{\dagger} S(x)  | 0..0\rangle |^2\\
#          &= | \langle \phi(x') | \phi(x)\rangle|^2 \\
#          &= \kappa(x, x').
#      \end{align*}
#
# Note that a projector :math:`|0..0 \rangle \langle 0..0|` can be constructed
# using the ``qml.Hermitian`` observable in PennyLane.
#
# Altogether, we use the following quantum node as a *quantum kernel
# evaluator*:

#    
#     Depending on the implementation of the SVM, only :math:`S \leq M_{\rm pred}`

######################################################################

# Which method scales best?
# -------------------------
#


######################################################################
# The answer to this question depends on how the variational model 
# is set up, and we need to make a few assumptions: 
#
# 1. Even if we use single-batch stochastic gradient descent, in which every training step uses 
#    exactly one training sample, we would want to see every training sample at least once on average. 
#    Therefore, the number of steps should scale at least linearly with the number of training data samples. 
#
# 2. Modern neural networks often have many more parameters than training
#    samples. But we do not know yet whether variational circuits really need that many parameters as well.
#    We will therefore use two cases for comparison: 
#
#    2a) the number of parameters grows linearly with the training data, or ``n_params = M``, 
#
#    2b) the number of parameters saturates at some point, which we model by setting ``n_params = sqrt(M)``. 
#
# Note that compared to the example above with 75 training samples and 24 parameters, a) overestimates the number of evaluations, while b) 
# underestimates it.

# This is the plot we saw at the beginning. 
# With current hardware-compatible training methods, whether kernel-based training 
# requires more or fewer quantum circuit evaluations 
# than variational training depends on how many parameters the latter needs. 
# If variational circuits turn out to be as parameter-hungry as neural networks,
# kernel-based training will outperform them for common machine learning tasks. However,
# if variational learning only turns out to require few parameters (or if more efficient training methods are found),
# variational circuits could in principle match the linear scaling of neural networks trained with backpropagation. 
#
# The practical take-away from this demo is that unless your variational circuit has significantly fewer 
# parameters than training data, kernel methods could be a much faster alternative!
#
# Finally, it is important to note that fault-tolerant quantum computers may change the picture  
# for both quantum and classical machine learning. 
# As mentioned in `Schuld (2021) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11020>`__, 
# early results from the quantum machine learning literature show that
# larger quantum computers will most likely enable us to reduce
# the quadratic scaling of kernel methods to linear scaling, which may make classical as well as quantum kernel methods a
# strong alternative to neural networks for big data processing one day.

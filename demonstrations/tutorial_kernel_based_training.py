*Author: PennyLane dev team. Posted: XX Feb 2021. Last updated: XX Feb 2021.*

This demonstration illustrates how one can train quantum machine
learning models with a kernel-based approach instead of the usual
`variational
approach <https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/variational_circuit.html>`__.
The theoretical background for kernel methods has been established in many papers
such as `Schuld and Killoran (2018) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07128>`__, `Havlicek et al. (2018) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11326>`__,
`Liu et al. (2020) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02174>`__, `Huang et al. (2020) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01938.pdf>`__,
and has been systematically summarized in the overview `Schuld (2021) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11020>`__ which we follow here.

As an example of kernel-based training, we use a combination of PennyLane
and the `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/>`__ machine
learning library to use a support vector machine with 
a *quantum kernel*. We then compare this strategy with a variational
quantum circuit trained via stochastic gradient descent using
`PyTorch <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/interfaces/torch.html>`__.

A secondary goal of the demo is to compare the number of circuit evaluations needed in
both approaches. For the example used here, kernel-based training requires only a fraction of the number of 
quantum circuit evaluations in variational circuit training, while each 
evaluation runs a much shorter circuit.    

More generally, we will see that the relative efficiency of kernel-based methods compared to variational circuits 
depends on the number of parameters used in the variational model:

       :align: center
       :scale: 100%
       :alt: Scaling of kernel-based vs. variational learning

If the number of variational parameters remains small (i.e. there is a square-root-like scaling with the number 
of data samples), variational circuits are almost as efficient as neural networks, and require much fewer circuit evaluations 
than the famous quadratic scaling of kernel methods. However, with current hardware-compatible training strategies, 
kernel methods can still be better than variational circuits that require a number of parameters of the 
order of the training set size. 

After working through this demo, the reader should:

* be able to use a support vector machine with a quantum kernel computed with PennyLane, and

* understand the scaling of quantum circuit evaluations required in kernel-based versus 
  variational training.

# Background
# ----------
#
# Let us consider a *quantum model* of the form
#
# .. math:: f(x) = \langle \phi(x) | \mathcal{M} | \phi(x)\rangle,
#
# where :math:`| \phi(x)\rangle` is prepared
# by a fixed `embedding
# circuit <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/templates.html#intro-ref-temp-emb>`__ that 
# encodes data inputs :math:`x`,
# and :math:`\mathcal{M}` is an arbitrary observable. This model includes variational 
# quantum machine learning models, since the observable can
# effectively be implemented by a simple measurement that is preceded by a
# variational circuit: 
#
#
# .. figure:: ../demonstrations/kernel_based_training/quantum_model.png 
#       :align: center
#       :scale: 20%
#       :alt: quantum-model
#
# |
# 
# For example, applying a circuit :math:`G(\theta)` and then
# measuring the Pauli-Z observable :math:`\sigma^0_z` of the first qubit
# implements the trainable measurement 
# :math:`\mathcal{M}(\theta) = G^{\dagger}(\theta) \sigma^0_z G(\theta)`.
#
# The main practical consequence of approaching quantum machine learning with a 
# kernel approach is that instead of training :math:`f` variationally,
# we can often train an equivalent classical kernel method with a kernel executed on a
# quantum device. This *quantum kernel*
# is given by the mutual overlap of two data-encoding quantum states,
#
# .. math::  \kappa(x, x') = | \langle \phi(x') | \phi(x)\rangle|^2.
#
# Kernel-based training therefore bypasses the variational part and
# measurement of common variational circuits, and only depends on the
# embedding.
#
# If the loss function :math:`L` is the `hinge
# loss <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinge_loss>`__, the kernel method
# corresponds to a standard `support vector
# machine <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine>`__ (SVM)
# in the sense of a maximum-margin classifier. Other convex loss functions
# lead to more general variations of support vector machines.
#
# .. note::
#
#    More precisely, we can replace variational with kernel-based 
#    training if the optimisation
#    problem can be written as minimizing a cost of the form
# 
#    .. math::  \min_f  \lambda\;  \mathrm{tr}\{\mathcal{M}^2\} + \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^M L(f(x^m), y^m), 
#
#    which is a regularized empirical risk with training data samples :math:`(x^m, y^m)_{m=1\dots M}`, 
#    regularisation strength :math:`\lambda \in \mathbb{R}`, and loss function :math:`L`.
#
#    Theory predicts that kernel-based training will always find better or equally good
#    minima of this risk. However, to show this here we would have
#    to either regularise the variational training by the trace of the squared observable, or switch off
#    regularisation in the classical SVM, which removes a lot of its strength. The kernel-based and the variational 
#    training in this demonstration therefore optimize slightly different cost
#    functions, and it is out of our scope to establish whether one training method finds a better minimum than
#    the other.

# Kernel-based training
# ---------------------
#
# First, we will turn to kernel-based training of quantum models. 
# As stated above, an example implementation is a standard support vector 
# machine with a kernel computed by a quantum circuit.
# 


######################################################################
# First, let’s import all sorts of useful methods:
#

import numpy as np
import torch
from torch.nn.functional import relu

from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

import pennylane as qml
from pennylane.templates import AngleEmbedding, StronglyEntanglingLayers
from pennylane.operation import Tensor

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

np.random.seed(42)


######################################################################
# The second step is to define a data set. Since the performance  
# of the models is not the focus of this demo, we can just use 
# the first two classes of the famous `Iris dataset <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set>`__. 
# Dating back to as far as 1936, 
# this toy data set consists of 100 samples of four features each, 
# and gives rise to a very simple classification problem.
#

X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True) 

# pick inputs and labels from the first two classes only
X = X[:100]
y = y[:100]

# scaling the inputs is important since the embedding we use is periodic
scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X)
X_scaled = scaler.transform(X)

# scaling the labels to -1, 1 is important for the SVM and the
# definition of a hinge loss
y_scaled = 2 * (y - 0.5)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y_scaled)


######################################################################
# We use the `angle embedding
# template <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.templates.embeddings.AngleEmbedding.html>`__
# which needs as many qubits as there are features:
#

n_qubits = len(X_train[0])
n_qubits


######################################################################
# To implement the kernel we could prepare the two states
# :math:`| \phi(x)\rangle`, :math:`| \phi(x')\rangle` on different sets of qubits
# with amplitude embedding routines :math:`S(x), S(x')` and measure their
# overlap with a small routine called a `SWAP test <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap_test>`__.
#
# However, we need only half the number of qubits if we prepare
# :math:`| \phi(x)\rangle` and then apply the inverse embedding
# with :math:`x'` on the same qubits. We then measure the projector onto
# the initial state :math:`|0\rangle \langle 0|`.

#
# To verify that this gives us the kernel:
#
# .. math::  \langle 0 |S(x') S(x)^{\dagger} |0\rangle \langle 0| S(x')^{\dagger} S(x)  | 0\rangle  = | \langle \phi(x') | \phi(x)\rangle|^2 = \kappa(x, x').
#
# Note that a projector :math:`|0 \rangle \langle 0|` can be constructed
# using the ``qml.Hermitian`` observable in PennyLane.
#
# Altogether, we use the following quantum node as a *quantum kernel
# evaluator*:
#

# A good sanity check is whether evaluating the kernel of a data point and 
# itself returns 1:

# The way an SVM with a custom kernel is implemented in scikit-learn

# pairwise distances between training vectors and test samples. 
#
# .. note:: 
#    
#     Depending on the implementation of the SVM, only :math:`S \leq M_{\rm pred}`
#     *support vectors* are needed.

######################################################################

######################################################################
# The single additional evaluation can be attributed to evaluating the kernel once above

######################################################################
# A similar example using variational training
# --------------------------------------------
#


######################################################################
# Using the variational principle of training, we can propose an *ansatz*
# for the (circuit before the) measurement and train it directly. By
# increasing the number of layers of the ansatz, its expressivity
# increases. Depending on the ansatz, we may only
# search through a subspace of all measurements for the best
# candidate.
#
# Remember from above, the variational training does not optimize
# *exactly* the same cost as the SVM, but we try to match them as closely
# as possible. For this we use a bias term in the quantum model, and train
# on the hinge loss. 
# 
# We also explicitely use the `parameter-shift <https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/parameter_shift.html>`__
# differentiation method in the quantum node, since this is a method which works on hardware as well. 
# While ``diff_method='backprop'`` or ``diff_method='adjoint'`` would reduce the number of 
# circuit evaluations significantly, they are based on tricks that are only suited for simulators, 
# and can therefore not scale to more than a few dozen qubits.

# Which method scales best?
# -------------------------
#


######################################################################
# Of course, the answer to this question depends on how the variational model 
# is set up, and we need to make a few assumptions: 
#
# 1. Even if we use single-batch stochastic gradient descent, in which every training step uses 
#    exactly one training sample, we would want to see every training sample at least once on average. 
#    Therefore, the number of steps should scale at least linearly with the number of training data. 
#
# 2. Modern neural networks often have many more parameters than training
#    samples. But we do not know yet whether variational circuits really need that many parameters as well.
#    We will therefore use two cases for comparison: 
#
#    2a) the number of parameters grows linearly with the training data, or ``n_params = M``, 
#
#    2b) the number of parameters saturates at some point, which we model by setting ``n_params = np.sqrt(M)``. 
#
# Note that compared to the example above with 75 training samples and 24 parameters, a) overestimates the number of evaluations, while b) 
# underestimates it.

# This is the plot we saw at the beginning. 
# With current hardware-compatible training methods, whether kernel-based training 
# requires more of fewer quantum circuit evaluations 
# than variational training depends on how many parameters the latter needs. 
# If variational circuits turn out to be as parameter-hungry as neural networks,
# kernel-based training will consistently outperform them for machine learning tasks. However,
# if variational learning only turns out to require few parameters (or if more efficient training methods are found),
# variational circuits could in principle match the linear scaling of neural networks trained with backpropagation. 
#
# The practical take-away from this demo is that unless your variational circuit has significantly fewer 
# parameters than training data, kernel methods could be a much faster alternative!
#
# Finally, it is important to note that fault-tolerant quantum computers may change the picture significantly - 
# for both quantum and classical machine learning. 
# As mentioned in `Schuld (2021) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11020>`__, 
# early results from the quantum machine learning literature show that
# larger quantum computers will most likely enable us to reduce
# the quadratic scaling of kernel methods to linear scaling, which may make classical as well as quantum kernel methods a
# serious alternative to neural networks for big data processing one day.

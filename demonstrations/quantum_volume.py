Twice per year, a project called the TOP500 [#top500]_ releases a list of the
500 most powerful supercomputing systems in the world. However, there is a large
amount of variation in how supercomputers are built. They may run different
operating systems and have varying amounts of memory. `Some
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugaku_(supercomputer)>`_ use 48-core processors,
while `others <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunway_TaihuLight>`_ use processors
with up to 260 cores. The speed of processors will differ, and they may be
connected in different ways. We can't rank them by simply counting the number of
processors!

In order to make a fair comparison, we need benchmarking standards that give us
a holistic view of their performance. To that end, the TOP500 rankings are based
on something called the LINPACK benchmark [#linpack]_. The task of the
supercomputers is to solve a dense system of linear equations, and the metric of
interest is the rate at which they perform `floating-point operations (FLOPS)
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS>`__. Today's top machines reach speeds well
into the regime of hundreds of petaFLOPS! While a single number certainly
cannot tell the whole story, it still gives us insight into the quality of the
machines, and provides a standard so we can compare them.

A similar problem is emerging with quantum computers: we can't judge quantum
computers on the number of qubits alone. Present-day devices have a number of
limitations, an important one being gate error rates. Typically
the qubits on a chip are not all connected to each other, so it may not be
possible to perform operations on arbitrary pairs of them.

Considering this, can we tell if a machine with 20 noisy qubits is better
than one with 5 very high-quality qubits? Or if a machine with 8 fully-connected
qubits is better than one with 16 qubits of comparable error rate, but arranged in
a square lattice?  How can we make comparisons between different
types of qubits?

    Which of these qubit hardware graphs is the best?

To compare across all these facets, researchers have proposed a metric called
"quantum volume" [#cross]_. Roughly, the quantum volume is a measure of the
effective number of qubits a processor has. It is calculated by determining the
largest number of qubits on which it can reliably run circuits of a prescribed
type. You can think of it loosely as a quantum analogue of the LINPACK
benchmark. Different quantum computers are tasked with solving the same problem,
and the success will be a function of many properties: error rates, qubit
connectivity, even the quality of the software stack. A single
number won't tell us everything about a quantum computer, but it does establish
a framework for comparing them.

After working through this tutorial, you'll be able to define quantum volume,
explain the problem on which it's based, and run the protocol to compute it!

#
# Designing a benchmark for quantum computers
# -------------------------------------------
#
# There are many different properties of a quantum computer
# that contribute to the successful execution of a computation. Therefore, we
# must be very explicit about what exactly we are benchmarking, and what is our
# measure of success. In general, to set up a benchmark for a quantum computer
# we need to decide on a number of things [#robin]_:
#
# 1. A family of circuits with a well-defined structure and variable size
# 2. A set of rules detailing how the circuits can be compiled
# 3. A measure of success for individual circuits
# 4. A measure of success for the family of circuits
# 5. (Optional) An experimental design specifying how the circuits are to be run
#
# We'll work through this list in order to see how the protocol for computing
# quantum volume fits within this framework.
#
# The circuits
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Quantum volume relates
# to the largest *square* circuit that a quantum processor can run reliably. This benchmark
# uses *random* square circuits with a very particular form:
#
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/quantum_volume/model_circuit_cross.png
#     :align: center
#     :width: 60%
#
#     ..
#
#     A schematic of the random circuit structure used in the quantum volume protocol.
#     Image source: [#cross]_.
#
# Specifically, the circuits consist of :math:`d` sequential layers acting on
# :math:`d` qubits. Each layer consists of two parts: a random permutation of
# the qubits, followed by Haar-random SU(4) operations performed on neighbouring
# pairs of qubits. (When the number of qubits is odd, the bottom-most qubit is
# idle while the SU(4) operations run on the pairs. However, it will still be
# incorporated by way of the permutations.) These circuits satisfy the criteria
# in item 1 — they have well-defined structure, and it is clear how they can be
# scaled to different sizes.
#
# As for the compilation rules of item 2, to compute quantum volume we're
# allowed to do essentially anything we'd like to the circuits in order to
# improve them. This includes optimization, hardware-aware considerations such
# as qubit placement and routing, and even resynthesis by finding unitaries that
# are close to the target, but easier to implement on the hardware [#cross]_.
#
# Both the circuit structure and the compilation highlight how quantum volume is
# about more than just the number of qubits. The error rates will affect the
# achievable depth, and the qubit connectivity contributes through the layers of
# permutations because a very well-connected processor will be able to implement
# these in fewer steps than a less-connected one. Even the quality of the
# software and the compiler plays a role here: higher-quality compilers will
# produce circuits that fit better on the target devices, and will thus produce
# higher quality results.
#
# The measures of success
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Now that we have our circuits, we have to define the quantities that will
# indicate how well we're able to run them. For that, we need a problem
# to solve. The problem used for computing quantum volume is called the *heavy output
# generation problem*. It has roots in the proposals for demonstrating quantum
# advantage [#aaronson]_. Many such proposals make use of the properties of
# various random quantum circuit families, as the distribution of the
# measurement outcomes may not be easy to sample using classical
# techniques.
#
# A distribution that is theorized to fulfill this property is the distribution
# of *heavy* output bit strings. Heavy bit strings are those whose outcome
# probabilities are above the median of the distribution. For example, suppose
# we run a two-qubit circuit and find that the measurement probabilities for
# the output states are as follows:

measurement_probs = {"00": 0.558, "01": 0.182, "10": 0.234, "11": 0.026}

##############################################################################
#
# The median of this probability distribution is:

import numpy as np
prob_array = np.fromiter(measurement_probs.values(), dtype=np.float64)
print(f"Median = {np.median(prob_array):.3f}")

##############################################################################
# .. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out
#
#
#  .. code-block:: none
#
#     Median = 0.208
#

##############################################################################
#
# This means that the heavy bit strings are '00' and '10', because these are
# the two probabilities above the median. If we were to run this circuit, the
# probability of obtaining one of the heavy outputs is:

heavy_output_prob = np.sum(prob_array[prob_array > np.median(prob_array)])
print(f"Heavy output probability = {heavy_output_prob}")

##############################################################################
# .. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out
#
#
#  .. code-block:: none
#
#     Heavy output probability = 0.792
#

##############################################################################
#
# Each circuit in a circuit family has its own heavy output probability. If our
# quantum computer is of high quality, then we should expect to see heavy
# outputs quite often across all the circuits. On the other hand, if it's of
# poor quality and everything is totally decohered, we will end up with output
# probabilities that are roughly all the same, as noise will reduce the
# probabilities to the uniform distribution.
#
# The heavy output generation problem quantifies this — for our family of
# random circuits, do we obtain heavy outputs at least 2/3 of the time on
# average?  Furthermore, do we obtain this with high confidence? This is the
# basis for quantum volume. Looking back at the criteria for our benchmarks, for
# item 3 the measure of success for each circuit is how often we obtain heavy
# outputs when we run the circuit and take a measurement. For item 4 the
# measure of success for the whole family is whether or not the mean of these
# probabilities is greater than 2/3 with high confidence.
#
# On a related note, it is important to determine what heavy output probability
# we should *expect* to see on average. The intuition for how this can be
# calculated is as follows [#aaronson]_, [#cmu]_.  Suppose that our random
# square circuits scramble things up enough so that the effective operation
# looks like a Haar-random unitary :math:`U`. Since in the circuits we are
# applying :math:`U` to the all-zero ket, the measurement outcome probabilities
# will be the moduli squared of the entries in the first column of :math:`U`.
#
# Now if :math:`U` is Haar-random, we can say something about the form of these
# entries. In particular, they are complex numbers for which both the real and
# imaginary parts are normally distributed with mean 0 and variance
# :math:`1/2^m`, where :math:`m` is the number of qubits. Taking the modulus
# squared of such numbers and making a histogram yields a distribution
# of probabilities with the form :math:`\hbox{Pr}(p) \sim 2^m e^{-2^m p}.` This
# is also known as the *Porter-Thomas distribution*.
#
# By looking at the form of the underlying probability distribution, the
# exponential distribution :math:`\hbox{Pr}(x) = e^{-x}`, we can calculate some
# properties of the heavy output probabilities. First, we can integrate the exponential
# distribution to find that the median sits at :math:`\ln 2`.  We can further
# compute the expectation value of obtaining something greater than the median
# by integrating :math:`x e^{-x}` from :math:`\ln 2` to :math:`\infty` to obtain
# :math:`(1 + \ln 2)/2`. This is the expected heavy output probability!
# Numerically it is around 0.85, as we will observe later in our results.
#
#
# The benchmark
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Now that we have our circuits and our measures of success, we're ready to
# define the quantum volume.
#
#
# .. admonition:: Definition
#     :class: defn
#
#     The quantum volume :math:`V_Q` of an :math:`n`-qubit processor is defined as [#cross]_
#
#     .. math::
#         \log_2(V_Q) = \hbox{argmax}_m \min (m, d(m))
#
#     where :math:`m \leq n` is a number of qubits, and :math:`d(m)` is the number of
#     qubits in the largest square circuits for which we can reliably sample
#     heavy outputs with probability greater than 2/3.
#
# To see this more concretely, suppose we have a 20-qubit device and find that
# we get heavy outputs reliably for up to depth-4 circuits on any set of 4
# qubits, then the quantum volume is :math:`\log_2 V_Q = 4`. Quantum volume is
# incremental, as shown below — we gradually work our way up to larger
# circuits, until we find something we can't do.  Very loosely, quantum volume
# is like an effective number of qubits. Even if we have those 20 qubits, only
# groups of up to 4 of them work well enough together to sample from
# distributions that would be considered hard.
#
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/quantum_volume/qv_square_circuits.svg
#     :align: center
#     :width: 75%
#
#     ..
#
#     This quantum computer has :math:`\log_2 V_Q = 4`, as the 4-qubit square
#     circuits are the largest ones it can run successfully.
#
#
# The maximum achieved quantum volume has been doubling at an increasing rate. In
# late 2020, the most recent announcements have been :math:`\log_2 V_Q = 6` on
# IBM's 27-qubit superconducting device `ibmq_montreal` [#qv64]_, and
# :math:`\log_2 V_Q = 7` on a Honeywell trapped-ion qubit processor
# [#honeywell]_. A device with an expected quantum volume of :math:`\log_2 V_Q
# = 22` has also been announced by IonQ [#ionq]_, though benchmarking results
# have not yet been published.
#
# .. note::
#
#    In many sources, the quantum volume of processors is reported as
#    :math:`V_Q` explicitly, rather than :math:`\log_2 V_Q` as is the
#    convention in this demo. As such, IonQ's processor has the potential for a
#    quantum volume of :math:`2^{22} > 4000000`. Here we use the :math:`\log`
#    because it is more straightforward to understand that they have 22
#    high-quality, well-connected qubits than to extract this at first glance from the
#    explicit value of the volume.
#


##############################################################################
#
# Computing the quantum volume
# ----------------------------
#
# Equipped with our definition of quantum volume, it's time to compute it
# ourselves! We'll use the `PennyLane-Qiskit
# <https://pennylaneqiskit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ plugin to compute the
# volume of a simulated version of one of the IBM processors, since their properties are easily
# accessible through this plugin.
#
#
# Loosely, the protocol for quantum volume consists of three steps:
#
# 1. Construct random square circuits of increasing size
#
# 2. Run those circuits on both a simulator and on a noisy hardware device
#
# 3. Perform a statistical analysis of the results to determine what size
#    circuits the device can run reliably
#
#
# The largest reliable size will become the :math:`m` in the expression for
# quantum volume.
#
#
# Step 1: construct random square circuits
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Recall that the structure of the circuits above is alternating layers of
# permutations and random SU(4) operations on pairs of qubits.  Let's implement
# the generation of such circuits in PennyLane.
#
# First we write a function that randomly permutes qubits. We'll do this by
# using numpy to generate a permutation, and then apply it with the built-in
# :func:`~.pennylane.Permute` subroutine.

import pennylane as qml

# Object for random number generation from numpy
rng = np.random.default_rng()

def permute_qubits(num_qubits):
    # A random permutation
    perm_order = list(rng.permutation(num_qubits))
    qml.Permute(perm_order, wires=list(range(num_qubits)))


##############################################################################
#
# Next, we need to apply SU(4) gates to pairs of qubits. PennyLane doesn't have
# built-in functionality to generate these random matrices, however its cousin
# `Strawberry Fields <https://strawberryfields.ai/>`_ does! We will use the
# ``random_interferometer`` method, which can generate unitary matrices uniformly
# at random. This function actually generates elements of U(4), but they are
# essentially equivalent up to a global phase.

from strawberryfields.utils import random_interferometer

def apply_random_su4_layer(num_qubits):
    for qubit_idx in range(0, num_qubits, 2):
        if qubit_idx < num_qubits - 1:
            rand_haar_su4 = random_interferometer(N=4)
            qml.QubitUnitary(rand_haar_su4, wires=[qubit_idx, qubit_idx + 1])


##############################################################################
#
# Next, let's write a layering method to put the two together — this is just
# for convenience and to highlight the fact that these two methods together
# make up one layer of the circuit depth.
#


def qv_circuit_layer(num_qubits):
    permute_qubits(num_qubits)
    apply_random_su4_layer(num_qubits)


##############################################################################
#
# Let's take a look! We'll set up an ideal device with 5 qubits, and generate a
# circuit with 3 qubits. In this demo, we'll work explicitly with `quantum tapes
# <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code/qml_tape.html>`__ since they
# are not immediately tied to a device. This will be convenient later when we
# need to run the same random circuit on two devices independently.

num_qubits = 5
dev_ideal = qml.device("lightning.qubit", shots=None, wires=num_qubits)

m = 3  # number of qubits

with qml.tape.QuantumTape() as tape:
    qml.layer(qv_circuit_layer, m, num_qubits=m)

expanded_tape = tape.expand(stop_at=lambda op: isinstance(op, qml.QubitUnitary))

# The first thing to note is that the last two qubits are never used in the
# operations, since the quantum volume circuits are square. Another important
# point is that this circuit with 3 layers actually has depth much greater than
# 3, since each layer has both SWAPs and SU(4) operations that are further
# decomposed into elementary gates when run on the actual processor.
#
# One last thing we'll need before running our circuits is the machinery to
# determine the heavy outputs. This is quite an interesting aspect of the
# protocol — we're required to compute the heavy outputs classically in order
# to get the results! As a consequence, it will only be possible to calculate
# quantum volume for processors up to a certain point before they become too
# large.
#
# That said, classical simulators are always improving, and can simulate
# circuits with numbers of qubits well into the double digits (though they may
# need a supercomputer to do so). Furthermore, the designers of the protocol
# don't expect this to be an issue until gate error rates decrease below
# :math:`\approx 10^{-4}`, after which we may need to make adjustments to remove

# probabilities are also above the threshold (except one).  But it isn't enough
# that just the mean of the heavy output probabilities is greater than 2/3. Since we're
# dealing with randomness, we also want to ensure these results were not just a
# fluke! To be confident, we also want to be above 2/3 within 2 standard

# At this point, we're going to do some statistical sorcery and make some

# binary outcome. When we sample many circuits, it is almost like we are
# sampling from a *binomial distribution* where the outcome probability is
# equivalent to the heavy output probability. In the limit of a large number of
# samples (in this case 200 circuits), a binomial distribution starts to look
# like a normal distribution. If we make this approximation, we can compute the standard
# deviation and use it to make our confidence interval. With the normal
# approximation, the standard deviation is
#
# .. math::
#

#
# This framework and code will allow you to calculate the quantum volume of many
# different processors. Try it yourself! What happens if we don't specify a
# large amount of compiler optimization? How does the volume compare across
# different hardware devices? You can even build your own device configurations
# and noise models to explore the extent to which different factors affect the
# volume.
#
# Concluding thoughts
# -------------------
#
# Quantum volume is a metric used for comparing the quality of different quantum
# computers. By determining the largest square random circuits a processor can
# run reliably, it provides a measure of the effective number of qubits a
# processor has. Furthermore, it goes beyond just gauging quality by a number of
# qubits — it incorporates many different aspects of a device such as its
# compiler, qubit connectivity, and gate error rates.
#
# However, as with any benchmark, it is not without limitations. A key one
# already discussed is that the heavy output generation problem requires us to
# simulate circuits classically in addition to running them on a device. While
# this is perhaps not an issue now, it will surely become one in the future. The
# number of qubits continues to increase and error rates are getting lower,
# both of which imply that our square circuits will be growing in both width and
# depth as time goes on. Eventually they will reach a point where they are no
# longer classical simulable, and we will have to design new benchmarks.
#
# Another limitation is that the protocol only looks at one type of circuit,
# i.e., square circuits. It might be the case that a processor has very few
# qubits, but also very low error rates. For example, what if a processor with 5
# qubits can run circuits with up to 20 layers? Quantum volume would limit us to
# :math:`\log_2 V_Q = 5` and the high quality of those qubits is not reflected
# in this.  To that end, a more general *volumetric benchmark* framework was
# proposed that includes not only square circuits, but also rectangular circuits
# [#robin]_. Investigating very deep circuits on few qubits (and very shallow
# circuits on many qubits) will give us a broader overview of a processor's
# quality. Furthermore, the flexibility of the framework of [#robin]_ will
# surely inspire us to create new types of benchmarks. Having a variety of
# benchmarks calculated in different ways is beneficial and gives us a broader
# view of the performance of quantum computers.

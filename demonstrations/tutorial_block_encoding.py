Prominent quantum algorithms such as quantum phase estimation and quantum singular value
transformation sometimes use **non-unitary** matrices inside quantum circuits. This is problematic
because quantum computers can only perform unitary evolutions. Block encoding is a technique 
that solves this problem by embedding a non-unitary operator as a sub-block of a larger unitary 
matrix. 

In previous demos we have discussed methods for `simulator-friendly <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_intro_qsvt#transforming-matrices-encoded-in-matrices>`_
encodings and block encodings using `linear combination of unitaries (LCU) decompositions <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_lcu_blockencoding>`_.
In this tutorial we explore another general block encoding method that can be very efficient for
sparse and structured matrices.

Circuits with matrix access oracles can block encode an arbitrary matrix :math:`A`. These circuits
can be constructed as shown in the figure below.

.. figure:: ../demonstrations/block_encoding/general_circuit.png

    :align: center

The :math:`U_A` and :math:`U_B` operations are oracles which give us access to the elements of the
matrix we wish to block encode and the :math:`H^{\otimes n}` operation a Hadamard transformation on
:math:`n` qubits. Finding the optimal sequence of the quantum gates that implement :math:`U_A` and
:math:`U_B` is not always possible. We now explore two approaches for the construction of
these oracles that can be very efficient for matrices with specific sparsity and structure.

Block encoding with FABLE
-------------------------
The "Fast Approximate quantum circuits for BLock Encodings" (FABLE) technique is a general method
for block encoding dense and sparse matrices [#fable]. The level of approximation in FABLE can be adjusted
to simplify the resulting circuit. For matrices with specific structures, FABLE provides an
efficient circuit without reducing accuracy.

The FABLE circuit is constructed from a set of rotation and C-NOT gates. The rotation angles,
:math:`(\theta_1, ..., \theta_n)`, are obtained from a transformation of the elements of
the block encoded matrix

.. math:: \begin{pmatrix} \theta_1 \\ \hdots \\ \theta_n \end{pmatrix} = M \begin{pmatrix} \alpha_1 \\ \hdots \\ \alpha_n \end{pmatrix},

where the angles :math:`\alpha` are obtained from the matrix elements of the matrix :math:`A` as
:math:`\alpha_1 = \text{arccos}(A_{00}), ...` and :math:`M` is the transformation matrix that can be
obtained with the :func:`~.pennylane.templates.state_preparations.mottonen.compute_theta` function.

Let's now construct the FABLE block encoding circuit for a structured matrix.

# You can see that the compressed circuit is equivalent to the original circuit. This happens

# Block-encoding sparse matrices
# ------------------------------
# The quantum circuit for the oracle :math:`U_A`, presented above, accesses every entry of
# :math:`A` and thus requires :math:`~ O(N^2)` gates to implement the oracle ([#fable]_). In the
# special cases where :math:`A` is structured and sparse, we can generate a more efficient quantum
# circuit representation for :math:`U_A` and :math:`U_B` [#sparse]. Let's look at an example.
#
# Consider the sparse matrix given by:
#
# .. math:: A = \begin{bmatrix}
#       \alpha & \gamma & 0 & \dots & \beta\\
#       \beta & \alpha & \gamma & \ddots & 0 \\
#       0 & \beta & \alpha & \gamma \ddots & 0\\
#       0 & \ddots & \beta & \alpha & \gamma\\
#       \gamma & 0 & \dots & \beta & \alpha \\
#       \end{bmatrix},
#
# where :math:`\alpha`, :math:`\beta` and :math:`\gamma` are real numbers. The following code block
# prepares the matrix representation of :math:`A` for an :math:`8 \times 8` sparse matrix.

alpha, beta, gamma  = 0.1, 0.6, 0.3

# The next step is to identify and prepare the qubit registers used in the oracle access framework. 
# There are three registers ("ancilla", "wires_i", "wires_j"): 
# 
# The "ancilla" register will always contain a single qubit, this is the target where we apply the
# controlled rotation gates. The "wires_i" register needs to be large enough to binary encode the 
# maximum number of non-zero entries in any column or row. Given the structure of :math:`A` defined 
# above, we have at most 3 non-zero entries, thus this register will have 2 qubits. Finally, the 
# "wires_j" register will be used to encode :math:`A` itself, so it will have 3 qubits. We prepare 
# the wires below:

ancilla_wires = ["ancilla"]    # always 1 qubit for controlled rotations
wires_i = ["i0", "i1"]         # depends on the sparse structure of A
wires_j = ["j0", "j1", "j2"]   # depends on the size of A

# You can confirm that the circuit block encodes the original sparse matrix defined above.
# Note that if we wanted to increase the dimension of A (for example 16 x 16), then we need
# only to add more wires to the "j" register in the device and :code:`UB`. 
#
# Conclusion
# -----------------------
# Block encoding is a powerful technique in quantum computing that allows us to implement a non-unitary
# operation in a quantum circuit by embedding the operation in a larger unitary gate.
# In this demo, we reviewed two important block encoding methods with code examples using PennyLane.
# The block encoding functionality provided in PennyLane allows you to explore and benchmark several
# block encoding approaches for a desired problem. The efficiency of the block encoding methods
# typically depends on the sparsity and structure of the original matrix. We hope that you can use 
# these tips and tricks to find a more efficient block encoding for your matrix!

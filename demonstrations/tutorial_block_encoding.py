Prominent quantum algorithms such as quantum phase estimation and quantum singular value
transformation sometimes need to use **non-unitary** matrices inside quantum circuits. This is problematic
because quantum computers can only perform unitary evolutions. ðŸ”¥ Block encoding is a technique
that solves this problem by embedding a non-unitary operator as a sub-block of a larger unitary 
matrix. ðŸ§¯

In previous demos we have discussed methods for `simulator-friendly <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_intro_qsvt#transforming-matrices-encoded-in-matrices>`_
encodings and block encodings using `linear combination of unitaries <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_lcu_blockencoding>`_
(LCU) decompositions. In this tutorial we explore another general block encoding method that can be
very efficient for sparse and structured matrices.

Circuits with matrix access oracles [#fable, #sparse]_ can block encode an arbitrary matrix
:math:`A`. These circuits can be constructed as shown in the figure below.

.. figure:: ../demonstrations/block_encoding/general_circuit.png
    :width: 50%
    :align: center

The :math:`U_A` and :math:`U_B` operations are oracles which provide access to the elements of the
matrix we wish to block encode and the :math:`H^{\otimes n}` operation is a Hadamard transformation
on :math:`n` qubits. Finding the optimal sequence of the quantum gates that implement :math:`U_A`
and :math:`U_B` is not always trivial. We now explore two approaches for constructing these oracles
that can be very efficient for matrices with specific sparsity and structure.

Block encoding with FABLE
-------------------------
The Fast Approximate BLock Encodings (FABLE) technique is a general method for block encoding dense
and sparse matrices [#fable]_. The level of approximation in FABLE can be adjusted to simplify the
resulting circuit. For matrices with specific structures, FABLE provides an efficient circuit
without reducing accuracy.

The FABLE circuit is constructed from a set of rotation and C-NOT gates. The rotation angles,
:math:`(\theta_1, ..., \theta_n)`, are obtained from a transformation of the elements of
the block-encoded matrix.

.. math:: \begin{pmatrix} \theta_1 \\ \cdots \\ \theta_n \end{pmatrix} =
          M \begin{pmatrix} \alpha_1 \\ \cdots \\ \alpha_n \end{pmatrix},

The angles :math:`\alpha` are obtained from the matrix elements of the matrix :math:`A` as
:math:`\alpha_1 = \text{arccos}(A_{00}), ...,` and :math:`M` is the transformation matrix that can
be obtained with the :func:`~.pennylane.templates.state_preparations.mottonen.compute_theta()`
function.

Let's now construct the FABLE block encoding circuit for a structured matrix.

# Block encoding sparse matrices
# ------------------------------
# The quantum circuit for the oracle :math:`U_A`, presented above, accesses every entry of
# :math:`A` and thus requires :math:`~ O(N^2)` gates to implement the oracle [#fable]_. In the
# special cases where :math:`A` is structured and sparse, we can generate a more efficient quantum
# circuit representation for :math:`U_A` and :math:`U_B` [#sparse]_. Let's look at an example.
#
# Consider the sparse matrix given by:
#
# .. math:: A = \begin{bmatrix}
#       \alpha & \gamma & 0 & \dots & \beta\\
#       \beta & \alpha & \gamma & \ddots & 0 \\
#       0 & \beta & \alpha & \gamma \ddots & 0\\
#       0 & \ddots & \beta & \alpha & \gamma\\
#       \gamma & 0 & \dots & \beta & \alpha \\
#       \end{bmatrix},
#
# where :math:`\alpha`, :math:`\beta` and :math:`\gamma` are real numbers. The following code block
# prepares the matrix representation of :math:`A` for an :math:`8 \times 8` sparse matrix.

# Once again we identify and prepare the qubit registers used in the oracle access framework:

# encode the maximum number of non-zero entries in any column or row. Given the structure of
# :math:`A` defined above, we have at most 3 non-zero entries, thus this register will have 2
# qubits. Finally, the :code:`"wires_j"` register will be used to encode :math:`A` itself, so it
# will have 3 qubits. We prepare the wires below:

s = int(np.log2(A.shape[0]))  # number of qubits needed to encode A

ancilla_wires = ["ancilla"]   # always 1 qubit for controlled rotations

#
# Conclusion
# -----------------------
# Block encoding is a powerful technique in quantum computing that allows us to implement a
# non-unitary operation in a quantum circuit by embedding the operation in a larger unitary gate.
# In this tutorial, we reviewed two important block encoding methods with code examples using
# PennyLane. This allows you to use PennyLane to explore and benchmark several block encoding
# approaches for a desired problem. The efficiency of the block encoding methods typically depends
# on the sparsity and structure of the original matrix. We hope that you can use these tips and
# tricks to find a more efficient block encoding for your matrix!

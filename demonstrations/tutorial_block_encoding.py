Block encoding with matrix access oracles
=========================================


Prominent quantum algorithms such as quantum phase estimation and quantum singular value
transformation sometimes need to use **non-unitary** matrices inside quantum circuits. This is problematic
because quantum computers can only perform unitary evolutions 🔥. Block encoding is a technique
that solves this problem by embedding a non-unitary operator as a sub-block of a larger unitary 
matrix 🧯.

In previous demos we have discussed methods for `simulator-friendly <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_intro_qsvt#transforming-matrices-encoded-in-matrices>`_
encodings and block encodings using `linear combination of unitaries <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_lcu_blockencoding>`_
(LCU) decompositions. In this tutorial we explore another general block encoding framework that can be
very efficient for sparse and structured matrices: block encoding with matrix access oracles.

A general circuit for block encoding an arbitrary matrix :math:`A \in \mathbb{C}^{N \times N}` with
:math:`N = 2^{n}` can be constructed as shown in the figure below, if we have access to the oracles 
:math:`U_A` and :math:`U_B`:

.. figure:: ../demonstrations/block_encoding/general_circuit.png
    :width: 50%
    :align: center

Where the :math:`H^{\otimes n}` operation is a Hadamard transformation on :math:`n` qubits. The
:math:`U_A` operation is an oracle which encodes the matrix element :math:`A_{i,j}` into the the 
amplitude of the ancilla qubit. The :math:`U_B` oracle ensures that we iterate over every 
combination of :math:`(i,j)`.

Finding an optimal quantum gate decomposition that implements :math:`U_A` and :math:`U_B` is not 
always possible. We now explore two different approaches for constructing these oracles that can be 
very efficient for matrices with specific structure or sparsity.

Block encoding structured matricies 
-----------------------------------
In order to better understand the oracle access framework let us first define :math:`U_A` and :math:`U_B`
For the exact block-encoding of :math:`A`. The :math:`U_A` oracle is responsible for encoding the 
matrix entries of :math:`A` into the amplitude of an auxillary qubit :math:`|0\rangle_{\text{anc}}`:

.. math::

    U_A |0\rangle_{\text{anc}} |i\rangle |j\rangle = |A_{i,j}\rangle_{\text{anc}} |i\rangle |j\rangle,

where

.. math::

    |A_{i,j}\rangle_{\text{anc}} \equiv A_{i,j}|0\rangle_{\text{anc}} + \sqrt{1 - |A_{i,j}|^2}|1\rangle_{\text{anc}}.

The :math:`U_B` oracle is responsible for ensuring proper indexing of each entry in :math:`A` 
and for this algorithm, it simplifies to be the :class:`~.pennylane.SWAP` gate:

.. math:: U_B |i\rangle|j\rangle \ = \ |j\rangle |i\rangle

The naive approach is to construct :math:`U_A` using a sequence of multi-controlled :math:`Ry(\alpha)` 
rotation gates with rotation angles computed as :math:`\alpha = \text{arccos}(A_{i,j})`. It turns out
that this requires :math:`O(N^{4})` gates and is very inefficient. A more efficient approach is a 

The Fast Approximate BLock Encodings (FABLE) technique is a method for block encoding matrices [#fable]_
using the oracle access framework and some clever approximations 🧠. The level of approximation in FABLE 
can be adjusted to simplify the resulting circuit. For matrices with specific structures, FABLE provides an 
efficient circuit *without* reducing accuracy.

The FABLE circuit is constructed from a set of single :math:`Ry` rotation and C-NOT gates. We can remove
the need for multi-controlled rotations using a special transformation of the angles (see [#fable]_ for details).
The rotation angles, :math:`(\theta_1, ..., \theta_n)`, are obtained from a transformation of the elements 
of the block-encoded matrix.

.. math:: \begin{pmatrix} \theta_1 \\ \cdots \\ \theta_n \end{pmatrix} =
          M \begin{pmatrix} \alpha_1 \\ \cdots \\ \alpha_n \end{pmatrix}.

The angles :math:`\alpha` are obtained from the matrix elements of the matrix :math:`A` as
:math:`\alpha_1 = \text{arccos}(A_{00}), ...,` and :math:`M` is the transformation matrix that can
be obtained with the :func:`~.pennylane.templates.state_preparations.mottonen.compute_theta()`
function.

Let's now construct the FABLE block encoding circuit for a structured matrix.

# Block encoding sparse matrices
# ------------------------------
# The quantum circuit for the oracle :math:`U_A`, presented above, accesses every entry of
# :math:`A` and thus requires :math:`~ O(N^2)` gates to implement the oracle [#fable]_. In the
# special cases where :math:`A` is structured and sparse, we can generate a more efficient quantum
# circuit representation for :math:`U_A` and :math:`U_B` [#sparse]_ by only keeping track of the 
# non-zero entries of the matrix. 
#
# Let :math:`b(i,j)` be a function such that it takes a column index :math:`j` and returns the
# row index for the :math:`i^{th}` non-zero entry in that column of :math:`A`. Note, in this 
# formulation, the :math:`|i\rangle` qubit register now refers to the number of non-zero entries 
# in :math:`A`. For sparse matrices, this can be much smaller than :math:`N`, thus saving us many
# qubits. We use this to define :math:`U_A` and :math:`U_B`.
#
# Like in the structured approach the :math:`U_A` oracle is responsible for encoding the matrix 
# entries of :math:`A` into the amplitude of the ancilla qubit. However, we now use :math:`b(i,j)`
# to access the row index of the non-zero entries:
#
# .. math::
#
#     U_A |0\rangle_{\text{anc}} |i\rangle |j\rangle = |A_{b(i,j),j}\rangle_{\text{anc}} |i\rangle |j\rangle,
#
# where
#
# .. math::
#
#     |A_{l,j}\rangle_{\text{anc}} \equiv A_{l,j}|0\rangle_{\text{anc}} + \sqrt{1 - A_{l,j}^2}|1\rangle_{\text{anc}}.
#
# In this case the :math:`U_B` oracle is responsible for implmenting the :math:`b(i,j)` function 
# and taking us from the column index to the row index in the qubit register:
#
# .. math:: U_B |i\rangle|j\rangle \ = \ |i\rangle |b(i,j)\rangle
#
# Lets work through an example. Consider the sparse matrix given by:
#
# .. math:: A = \begin{bmatrix}
#       \alpha & \gamma & 0 & \dots & \beta\\
#       \beta & \alpha & \gamma & \ddots & 0 \\
#       0 & \beta & \alpha & \gamma \ddots & 0\\
#       0 & \ddots & \beta & \alpha & \gamma\\
#       \gamma & 0 & \dots & \beta & \alpha \\
#       \end{bmatrix},
#
# where :math:`\alpha`, :math:`\beta` and :math:`\gamma` are real numbers. The following code block
# prepares the matrix representation of :math:`A` for an :math:`8 \times 8` sparse matrix.

alpha, beta, gamma  = 0.1, 0.6, 0.3

A = np.array([[alpha, gamma,     0,     0,     0,     0,     0,  beta],

# Conclusion
# -----------------------
# Block encoding is a powerful technique in quantum computing that allows us to implement a
# non-unitary operation in a quantum circuit by embedding the operation in a larger unitary gate.
# In this tutorial, we reviewed two important block encoding methods with code examples using
# PennyLane. This allows you to use PennyLane to explore and benchmark several block encoding
# approaches for a desired problem. The efficiency of the block encoding methods typically depends
# on the sparsity and structure of the original matrix. We hope that you can use these tips and
# tricks to find a more efficient block encoding for your matrix!

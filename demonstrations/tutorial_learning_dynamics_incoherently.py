r"""Learning quantum dynamics incoherently: Variational learning using classical shadows
========================================================================================

How can we recreate and simulate an unknown quantum process with a quantum circuit? One approach is
to learn the dynamics of this process incoherently, as done by Jerbi et al. [#Jerbi]_. 
Here, we'll reproduce the numerical simulations of [#Jerbi]_ using the authors' data, as provided
in the
`Learning Dynamics Incoherently PennyLane Dataset <https://pennylane.ai/datasets/other/learning-dynamics-incoherently>`__. 

This approach differs from learning the quantum process *coherently* [#Huang]_ because it does not
require the model circuit to be connected to the target quantum process. That is, the model circuit
does not receive quantum information from the target process directly. Instead, we train the model
circuit using classical information from the classical shadow measurements. This works well for
low-entangling processes but can require an exponential number of classical shadow measurements,
depending on the unknown quantum process [#Jerbi]_. This is useful because
it's not always possible to port the quantum output of a system directly to hardware without
first measuring it.

In simple terms, learning dynamics incoherently consists of two steps. First, we measure the output
of the unknown process for many different inputs. For example, we will measure
:doc:`classical shadows <tutorial_classical_shadows>` of the target process output.
Then, we adjust a variational quantum circuit
until it produces the same input-output combinations as the unknown process. In this tutorial, we
simulate the model circuit output and use the classical shadow measurements to estimate the
overlap between the model output states and the unknown process output states.

# 1. Creating an unknown target quantum process
# ----------------------------------------------
#
# For our unknown quantum process, we will use the
# `time evolution of a Hamiltonian <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qaoa_intro/#circuits-and-hamiltonians>`_:
#
# .. math:: U(H, t) = e^{-i H t / \hbar} .
#
# For the Hamiltonian, :math:`H`, we choose a transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian (as in
# [#Jerbi]_):
#
# .. math:: H = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} Z_iZ_{i+1} + \sum_{i=0}^{n}\alpha_iX_i,
#
# where :math:`n` is the number of qubits and :math:`\alpha` are randomly generated weights.
# 
# More sppecifically, we will approximate :math:`U(H, t)` via
# `Trotterization <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_simulation#Product_formulas>`_.
# We first create the Hamiltonian and Trotterize later with :class:`~pennylane.TrotterProduct`.
#

import pennylane as qml
from pennylane import numpy as pnp
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# number of qubits for the Hamiltonian
n_qubits = 2

# set random seed for reproducibility
pnp.random.seed(7)
np.random.seed(7)

# generate random weights
alphas = np.random.normal(0, 0.5, size=n_qubits)

# create the Hamiltonian
hamiltonian = qml.sum(
    *[qml.PauliZ(wires=i) @ qml.PauliZ(wires=i + 1) for i in range(n_qubits - 1)]
) + qml.dot(alphas, [qml.PauliX(wires=i) for i in range(n_qubits)])

# 2. Creating random initial states
# -----------------------------------
#
# The next step is to prepare a set of initial states. We will then apply the
# unknown quantum process to each of these states and measure the output to create input-output
# pairs. Later, we will train a model circuit to generate the same input-output pairs, thus
# reproducing the unknown quantum process.
#
# Ideally, our input states should be uniformly distributed over the state space. If they are all
# clustered together, our model circuit will not learn to approximate the unknown quantum process
# behavior for states that are very different from our training set.
#
# For quantum systems, this means we want to sample
# :doc:`Haar-random states <tutorial_haar_measure>`, as done below.
#

# .. note ::
#
#    On a personal computer, this method becomes slow (>1 second) around 10 qubits.

# 3. Time evolution and classical shadow measurements
# ----------------------------------------------------
#
# Now we can evolve the initial states using a Trotterized version of the
# `Hamiltonian above <#creating-an-unknown-target-quantum-process>`_. This
# will approximate the time evolution of the transverse-field Ising system.
#

# Since ``target_circuit`` returns :func:`~pennylane.classical_shadow`, running the circuit with a
# ``shot`` value gives the desired number of classical shadow measurements.
# We use this to create a set of shadows for each initial state.
#

######################################################################
# 4. Creating a model circuit that will learn the target process
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Now that we have the classical shadow measurements, we need to create a model circuit that
# learns to produce the same output as the target circuit.
#
# As done in [#Jerbi]_, we create a model circuit with the same gate structure as the target
# circuit. If the target quantum process were truly unknown, then we would choose a general
# variational quantum circuit like in the
# :doc:`Variational classifier demo </demos/tutorial_variational_classifier>`.
#
# .. note ::
#
#    We use *local* measurements to keep the computational complexity low and
#    because classical shadows are well-suited to estimating local observables [#Jerbi]_.
#    For this reason, the following circuit returns local density matrices for each qubit. In
#    hardware, the density matrix is obtained via state tomography using Pauli measurements or classical shadows.

# 5. Training using classical shadows in a cost function
# ------------------------------------------------------
#
# We now have to find the optimal parameters for ``model_circuit`` to mirror the ``target_circuit``.
# We can estimate the similarity between the circuits according to this cost function (see
# Appendix B of [#Jerbi]_):
#
# .. math:: C^l_N(\theta) = 1 - \frac{1}{nN}\sum^N_{j=1}\sum^n_{i=1}Tr[U|\psi^{(j)}\rangle\langle\psi^{(j)}|U^\dagger O^{(j)}_i(\theta)],
#
# where :math:`n` is the number of qubits, :math:`N` is the number of initial states, :math:`\psi^{(j)}`
# are random states, :math:`U` is our target unitary operation, and :math:`O_i` is the local density
# matrix for qubit :math:`i` after applying the ``model_circuit``. That is, the local states
# :math:`\rho_{i}^{(j)}` are used as the observables:
#
# .. math:: O_{i}^{(j)}(\theta) := \rho_{i}^{(j)}.
#
# We can calculate this cost for our system by using the
# `shadow measurements <#time-evolution-and-classical-shadow-measurements>`_ to estimate
# the expectation value of :math:`O_i`. Roughly, this cost function measures the fidelity between
# the model circuit and the target circuit, by proxy of the single-qubit reduced states
# :math:`\rho_{i}^{(j)}` of the model over a variety of input-output pairs.

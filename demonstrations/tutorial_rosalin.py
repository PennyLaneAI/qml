*Author: PennyLane dev team. Posted: 19 May 2020. Last updated: 20 Jan 2021.*

In this tutorial we investigate and implement the Rosalin (Random Operator Sampling for
Adaptive Learning with Individual Number of shots) from
Arrasmith et al. [#arrasmith2020]_. In this paper, a strategy
is introduced for reducing the number of shots required when optimizing variational quantum
algorithms, by both:

* Frugally adapting the number of shots used per parameter update, and
* Performing a weighted sampling of operators from the cost Hamiltonian.

Background
----------

While a large number of papers in variational quantum algorithms focus on the
choice of circuit ansatz, cost function, gradient computation, or initialization method,
the optimization strategy---an important component affecting both convergence time and
quantum resource dependence---is not as frequently considered. Instead, common
'out-of-the-box' classical optimization techniques, such as gradient-free
methods (COBLYA, Nelder-Mead), gradient-descent, and Hessian-free methods (L-BFGS) tend to be used.

However, for variational algorithms such as :doc:`VQE </demos/tutorial_vqe>`, which involve evaluating
a large number of non-commuting operators in the cost function, decreasing the number of
quantum evaluations required for convergence, while still minimizing statistical noise, can
be a delicate balance.

Recent work has highlighted that 'quantum-aware' optimization techniques
can lead to marked improvements when training variational quantum algorithms:

* :doc:`/demos/tutorial_quantum_natural_gradient` descent by Stokes et al. [#stokes2019]_, which
  takes into account the quantum geometry during the gradient-descent update step.

* The work of Sweke et al. [#sweke2019]_, which shows
  that quantum gradient descent with a finite number of shots is equivalent to
  `stochastic gradient descent <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent>`_,
  and has guaranteed convergence. Furthermore, combining a finite number of shots with
  weighted sampling of the cost function terms leads to :doc:`/demos/tutorial_doubly_stochastic`.

* The iCANS (individual Coupled Adaptive Number of Shots) optimization technique by
  Jonas Kuebler et al. [#kubler2020]_ adapts the number
  of shots measurements during training, by maximizing the expected gain per shot.

In this latest result by Arrasmith et al. [#arrasmith2020]_, the
idea of doubly stochastic gradient descent has been used to extend the iCANS optimizer,
resulting in faster convergence.

Over the course of this tutorial, we will explore their results; beginning first with a
demonstration of *weighted random sampling* of the cost Hamiltonian operators, before
combining this with the shot-frugal iCANS optimizer to perform doubly stochastic
Rosalin optimization.

Weighted random sampling
------------------------

Consider a Hamiltonian :math:`H` expanded as a weighted sum of operators :math:`h_i` that can
be directly measured:

.. math:: H = \sum_{i=1}^N c_i h_i.

Due to the linearity of expectation values, the expectation value of this Hamiltonian
can be expressed as the weighted sum of each individual term:

.. math:: \langle H\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^N c_i \langle h_i\rangle.

In the :doc:`doubly stochastic gradient descent demonstration </demos/tutorial_doubly_stochastic>`,
we estimated this expectation value by **uniformly sampling** a subset of the terms
at each optimization step, and evaluating each term by using the same finite number of shots
:math:`N`.

However, what happens if we use a weighted approach to determine how to distribute
our samples across the terms of the Hamiltonian? In **weighted random sampling** (WRS),
the number of shots used to determine the expectation value :math:`\langle h_i\rangle`
is a discrete random variable distributed according to a
`multinomial distribution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution>`__,

.. math:: S \sim \text{Multinomial}(p_i),

with event probabilities

.. math:: p_i = \frac{|c_i|}{\sum_i |c_i|}.

That is, the number of shots assigned to the measurement of the expectation value of the
:math:`i\text{th}` term of the Hamiltonian is drawn from a probability distribution
*proportional to the magnitude of its coefficient* :math:`c_i`.

To see this strategy in action, consider the Hamiltonian

.. math:: H = 2I\otimes X + 4 I\otimes Z  - X\otimes X + 5Y\otimes Y + 2 Z\otimes X.

We can solve for the ground state energy using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm.

# We can see that weighted random sampling performs just as well as the uniform

# Rosalin: Frugal shot optimization
# ---------------------------------
#
# We can see above that both methods optimize fairly well; weighted random
# sampling converges just as well as evenly distributing the shots across
# all Hamiltonian terms. However, deterministic shot distribution approaches
# will always have a minimum shot value required per expectation value, as below
# this threshold they become biased estimators. This is not the case with random
# sampling; as we saw in the
# :doc:`doubly stochastic gradient descent demonstration </demos/tutorial_doubly_stochastic>`,
# the introduction of randomness allows for as little
# as a single shot per expectation term, while still remaining an unbiased estimator.
#
# Using this insight, Arrasmith et al. [#arrasmith2020]_ modified the iCANS frugal
# shot-optimization technique [#kubler2020]_ to include weighted random sampling, making it
# 'doubly stochastic'.
#
# iCANS optimizer
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Two variants of the iCANS optimizer were introduced in Kübler et al., iCANS1 and iCANS2.
# The iCANS1 optimizer, on which Rosalin is based, frugally distributes a shot budget
# across the partial derivatives of each parameter, which are computed using the
# :doc:`parameter-shift rule </glossary/quantum_gradient>`. It works roughly as follows:
#
# 1. The initial step of the optimizer is performed with some specified minimum
#    number of shots, :math:`s_{min}`, for all partial derivatives.
#
# 2. The parameter-shift rule is then used to estimate the gradient :math:`g_i`
#    for each parameter :math:`\theta_i`, parameters, as well as the *variances*
#    :math:`v_i` of the estimated gradients.
#
# 3. Gradient descent is performed for each parameter :math:`\theta_i`, using
#    the pre-defined learning rate :math:`\alpha` and the gradient information :math:`g_i`:
#
#    .. math:: \theta_i = \theta_i - \alpha g_i.
#
# 4. The improvement in the cost function per shot, for a specific parameter value,
#    is then calculated via
#
#    .. math::
#
#        \gamma_i = \frac{1}{s_i} \left[ \left(\alpha - \frac{1}{2} L\alpha^2\right)
#                    g_i^2 - \frac{L\alpha^2}{2s_i}v_i \right],
#
#    where:
#
#    * :math:`L \leq \sum_i|c_i|` is the bound on the `Lipschitz constant
#      <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipschitz_continuity>`__ of the variational quantum algorithm objective function,
#
#    * :math:`c_i` are the coefficients of the Hamiltonian, and
#
#    * :math:`\alpha` is the learning rate, and *must* be bound such that :math:`\alpha < 2/L`
#      for the above expression to hold.
#
# 5. Finally, the new values of :math:`s_i` (shots for partial derivative of parameter
#    :math:`\theta_i`) is given by:
#
#    .. math::
#
#        s_i = \frac{2L\alpha}{2-L\alpha}\left(\frac{v_i}{g_i^2}\right)\propto
#              \frac{v_i}{g_i^2}.
#
# In addition to the above, to counteract the presence of noise in the system, a
# running average of :math:`g_i` and :math:`s_i` (:math:`\chi_i` and :math:`\xi_i` respectively)
# are used when computing :math:`\gamma_i` and :math:`s_i`.
#
# .. note::
#
#     In classical machine learning, the Lipschitz constant of the cost function is generally
#     unknown. However, for a variational quantum algorithm with cost of the form
#     :math:`f(x) = \langle \psi(x) | \hat{H} |\psi(x)\rangle`,
#     an upper bound on the Lipschitz constant is given by :math:`L < \sum_i|c_i|`,
#     where :math:`c_i` are the coefficients of :math:`\hat{H}` when decomposed
#     into a linear combination of Pauli-operator tensor products.
#
# Rosalin implementation
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Let's now modify iCANS above to incorporate weighted random sampling of Hamiltonian
# terms --- the Rosalin frugal shot optimizer.
#
# Rosalin takes several hyper-parameters:
#
# * ``min_shots``: the minimum number of shots used to estimate the expectations
#   of each term in the Hamiltonian. Note that this must be larger than 2 for the variance
#   of the gradients to be computed.
#
# * ``mu``: The running average constant :math:`\mu\in[0, 1]`. Used to control how quickly the
#   number of shots recommended for each gradient component changes.
#
# * ``b``: Regularization bias. The bias should be kept small, but non-zero.
#
# * ``lr``: The learning rate. Recall from above that the learning rate *must* be such
#   that :math:`\alpha < 2/L = 2/\sum_i|c_i|`.
#
# Since the Rosalin optimizer has a state that must be preserved between optimization steps,
# let's use a class to create our optimizer.
#

# The Rosalin optimizer performs significantly better than the Adam optimizer,
# approaching the ground state energy of the Hamiltonian with strikingly
# fewer shots.
#
# While beyond the scope of this demonstration, the Rosalin optimizer can be
# modified in various other ways; for instance, by incorporating *weighted hybrid
# sampling* (which distributes some shots deterministically, with the remainder
# done randomly), or by adapting the variant iCANS2 optimizer. Download
# this demonstration from the sidebar 👉 and give it a go! ⚛️

*Author: Andrea Mari. Last updated: 15 Jan 2021.*

In this tutorial we propose and implement an algorithm that we call
*coherent variational quantum linear solver* (CVQLS).
This is inspired by the VQLS proposed in Ref. [1] (implemented in a :doc:`previous demo <tutorial_vqls>`), with an important difference:
the matrix :math:`A` associated to the problem is physically
applied as a probabilistic coherent operation. This approach has some advantages and
disadvantages and its practical convenience depends on the specific linear problem
to be solved and on experimental constraints.

Introduction
------------

We first define the problem and the general structure of the CVQLS.
As a second step, we consider a particular case and we solve it explicitly with PennyLane.

The problem
^^^^^^^^^^^

We are given a :math:`2^n \times 2^n` matrix :math:`A` which can be expressed as a linear
combination of :math:`L` unitary matrices :math:`A_0, A_1, \dots A_{L-1}`, i.e.,

.. math::

    A = \sum_{l=0}^{L-1} c_l A_l,

where :math:`c_l` are arbitrary complex numbers. Importantly, we assume that each of the
unitary components :math:`A_l` can be efficiently implemented with a quantum circuit
acting on :math:`n` qubits.

We are also given a normalized complex vector in the physical form of a quantum
state :math:`|b\rangle`, which can be generated by a unitary operation :math:`U`
applied to the ground state of :math:`n` qubits. , i.e.,

.. math::

    |b\rangle = U_b |0\rangle,

where again we assume that :math:`U_b` can be efficiently implemented with a quantum circuit.

The problem that we aim to solve is that of preparing a quantum state :math:`|x\rangle`, such that
:math:`A |x\rangle` is proportional to :math:`|b\rangle` or, equivalently, such that

.. math::

    |\Psi\rangle :=  \frac{A |x\rangle}{\sqrt{\langle x |A^\dagger A |x\rangle}} \approx |b\rangle.


Coherent Variational Quantum Linear Solver (CVQLS)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We approximate the solution :math:`|x\rangle` with a variational quantum
circuit, i.e., a unitary circuit :math:`V` depending on a finite number of classical real parameters
:math:`w = (w_0, w_1, \dots)`:

.. math::

    |x \rangle = V(w) |0\rangle.

The parameters should be optimized in order to maximize the overlap between the quantum states
:math:`|\Psi\rangle` and :math:`|b\rangle`. We define the following cost function,

.. math::

    C = 1- |\langle b | \Psi \rangle|^2,

such that its minimization with respect to the variational parameters should lead towards the problem solution.

The approach used in Ref. [1] is to decompose the cost function in terms of many expectation values associated to the
individual components :math:`A_l` of the problem matrix :math:`A`. For this reason, in the VQLS of Ref. [1],
the state vector proportional to :math:`A |x\rangle` is not physically prepared.
On the contrary, the idea presented in this tutorial is to physically implement the linear map :math:`A` as
a coherent probabilistic operation. This approach allows to prepare the state
:math:`|\Psi\rangle :=  A |x\rangle/\sqrt{\langle x |A^\dagger A |x\rangle}` which can be used to estimate the
cost function of the problem in a more direct way.


Coherently applying :math:`A`
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

The problem of coherently applying a liner combination of unitary operations has been already studied in Ref. [2]
and here we follow a very similar approach.

Without loss of generality we can assume that the coefficients :math:`c=(c_1, c_2, \dots c_L)` appearing
in the definition of :math:`A` represent a positive and normalized probability distribution, i.e.,

.. math::

    c_l \ge 0 \quad \forall l,  \qquad \sum_{l=0}^{L-1} c_l=1.

Indeed the complex phase of each coefficient :math:`c_l` can always be absorbed into the associated unitary :math:`A_l`, obtaining
in this way a vector of positive values. Moreover, since the linear problem is
defined up to a constant scaling factor, we can also normalize the coefficients to get a probability distribution.

For simplicity, since we can always pad :math:`c` with additional zeros, we assume that :math:`L=2^m` for some positive integer :math:`m`.

Let us consider a unitary circuit :math:`U_c`, embedding the square root of :math:`c` into the quantum state :math:`|\sqrt{c}\rangle` of :math:`m` ancillary qubits:

.. math::

    |\sqrt{c} \rangle =  U_c |0\rangle = \sum_{l=0}^{L-1} \sqrt{c_l} | l \rangle,

where :math:`\{ |l\rangle \}` is the computational basis of the ancillary system.


Now, for each component :math:`A_l` of the problem matrix :math:`A`, we can define an associated controlled unitary operation :math:`CA_l`,
acting on the system and on the ancillary basis states as follows:

.. math::

    CA_l \, |j\rangle |l' \rangle  =
    \Bigg\{
    \begin{array}{c}
    \left(A_l \otimes \mathbb{I}\right) \; |j\rangle |l \rangle \quad \; \mathrm{for}\; l'=l \\
    \qquad \qquad |j\rangle |l' \rangle  \quad \mathrm{for}\; l'\neq l
    \end{array},

i.e., the unitary :math:`A_l` is applied only when the ancillary system is in the corresponding basis state :math:`|l\rangle`.

A natural generalization of the `Hadamard test <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_test_(quantum_computation)>`_, to the case of multiple unitary operations, is the following
(see also the figure at the top of this tutorial):

1. Prepare all qubits in the ground state.
2. Apply :math:`U_c` to the ancillary qubits.
3. Apply the variational circuit :math:`V` to the system qubits.
4. Apply all the controlled unitaries :math:`CA_l` for all values of :math:`l`.
5. Apply :math:`U_c^\dagger` to the ancillary qubits.
6. Measure the ancillary qubits in the computational basis.
7. If the outcome of the measurement is the ground state, the system collapses to
   :math:`|\Psi\rangle :=  A |x\rangle/\sqrt{\langle x |A^\dagger A |x\rangle}`.
   If the outcome is not the ground state, the experiment should be repeated.


Estimating the cost function
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

From a technical point of view, the previous steps represent the most difficult part of the algorithm.
Once we have at our disposal the quantum system prepared in the state :math:`|\Psi\rangle`,
it is very easy to compute the cost function.
Indeed one could simply continue the previous protocol with the following two steps:

8. Apply :math:`U_b^\dagger` to the system.
9. Measure the system in the computational basis. The probability of finding it
   in the ground state (given the ancillary qubits measured in their ground state),
   is :math:`|\langle 0 | U_b^\dagger |\Psi \rangle|^2 = |\langle b | \Psi \rangle|^2`.

So, with sufficiently many shots of the previous experiment, one can directly estimate
the cost function of the problem.

Importantly, the operations of steps 7 and 8 commute. Therefore all the measurements can be
delayed until the end of the quantum circuit (as shown in the figure at the top of this tutorial),
making the structure of the experiment more straightforward.

A simple example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this tutorial we apply the previous theory to the following simple example
based on a system of 3 qubits, which was already considered in Ref. [1] and also reproduced in PennyLane (:doc:`VQLS <tutorial_vqls>`):

.. math::
        \begin{align}
        A  &=  c_0 A_0 + c_1 A_1 + c_2 A_2 = \mathbb{I} + 0.2 X_0 Z_1 + 0.2 X_0, \\
        \\
        |b\rangle &= U_b |0 \rangle = H_0  H_1  H_2 |0\rangle,
        \end{align}

where :math:`Z_j, X_j, H_j` represent the Pauli :math:`Z`, Pauli :math:`X` and Hadamard gates applied to the qubit with index :math:`j`.

This problem is computationally quite easy since a single layer of local rotations is enough to generate the
solution state, i.e., we can use the following simple ansatz:

.. math::
        |x\rangle = V(w) |0\rangle = \Big [  R_y(w_0) \otimes  R_y(w_1) \otimes  R_y(w_2) \Big ]  H_0  H_1  H_2 |0\rangle.


In the code presented below we solve this particular problem, by following the general scheme of the CVQLS previously discussed.
Eventually we will compare the quantum solution with the classical one.

General setup

This Python code requires *PennyLane* and the plotting library *matplotlib*.

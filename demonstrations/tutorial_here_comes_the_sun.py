How do we choose an ansatz when designing a quantum circuit for a variational
quantum algorithm? And what happens if we do not start with elementary hardware-friendly
gates and compose them, but we instead use a more complex building block for local qubit
interactions and allow for multi-parameter gates from the start?
Can we differentiate such circuits, and how do they perform in optimization tasks?

Let's find out!

In this tutorial, you will learn about the :math:`\mathrm{SU}(N)` gate
:class:`~pennylane.SpecialUnitary`, a particular quantum gate which
can act like *any* gate on its qubits by choosing the parameters accordingly.
We will look at a custom derivative rule [#wiersema]_ for this gate and compare it to two
alternative differentiation strategies, namely finite differences and the `stochastic
parameter-shift rule <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_stochastic_parameter_shift.html>`_.
Finally, we will compare the performance of
``qml.SpecialUnitary`` for a toy minimization problem to that of two other general
local gates. That is, we compare the trainability of equally expressive ansätze.

Ansätze, so many ansätze
------------------------

Variational quantum algorithms have been promoted to be useful for many applications.
When designing these algorithms, a central task is to choose the quantum circuit ansatz,
which provides a parameterization of quantum states. In the course of a variational algorithm,
the circuit parameters are then optimized in order to minimize some cost function.
The choice of the ansatz can have a big impact on the quantum states that can be found
by the algorithm (expressivity) and on the optimization's behaviour (trainability).

Typically, it also affects the
computational cost of executing the algorithm on quantum hardware and the strength of the noise
that enters the computation. Finally, the application itself influences, or
even fixes, the choice of ansatz for some variational quantum algorithms,
which can lead to constraints in the ansatz design.

While a number of best practices for ansatz design have been developed,
a lot is still unknown about the connection between circuit structures and the
resulting properties. Therefore, circuit design is often also based on intuition or heuristics;
an ansatz reported in the literature might just have turned out
to work particularly well for a given problem or might fall into a "standard"
category of circuits.

If the application does not constrain the choice of ansatz, we may want to avoid choosing
somewhat arbitrary circuit ansätze that may introduce undesirable biases.
Instead, we will want to reflect the generic structure of the problem by performing a
fully general operation on the qubit register.
However, if we were to do so, the number of parameters required to produce such a general
operation would grow much too quickly. Instead, we want to consider fully general operations
*on a few qubits* and compose them into a fabric of local gates. For two-qubit operations,
the fabric could look like this:

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/here_comes_the_sun/SUN_demo_SU4.png
    :align: center
    :width: 60%

The general local operation can be implemented by composing a suitable combination
of elementary gates, like single-qubit rotations and CNOT gates. Alternatively, we may
choose a canonical parameterization of the group that contains all local operations, and we will
see that this is an advantageous approach for the trainability of the ansatz.

    :align: center
    :width: 60%

Before we can use the :math:`\mathrm{SU}(N)` gate in training, we will need to
learn how to differentiate it in a quantum circuit. But first things first:
let's start with a brief math intro — no really, just a *Liettle* bit.

The special unitary group SU(N) and its Lie algebra
---------------------------------------------------

The gate we will look at is given by a specific parameterization of the
`special unitary group <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_unitary_group>`__
:math:`\mathrm{SU}(N)`, where :math:`N=2^n` is the Hilbert space dimension of the gate
for :math:`n` qubits. Mathematically, the group can be defined as the set of operators
(or matrices) that can be inverted by taking their adjoint and that have
determinant :math:`1`. In general, all quantum gates acting on :math:`n` qubits are
elements of :math:`\mathrm{SU}(N)` up to a global phase.

The group :math:`\mathrm{SU}(N)` is a `Lie group <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group>`__,
and its associated `Lie algebra <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra>`__
is :math:`\mathfrak{su}(N)`. For our purposes, it will be sufficient to look at a matrix
representation of the algebra and we may define it as

.. math::

    \mathfrak{su}(N) =
    \{\Omega \in \mathbb{C}^{N\times N}: \Omega^\dagger=-\Omega, \operatorname{Tr}[\Omega]=0\}.

The conditions are that the elements :math:`\Omega` are *skew-Hermitian* and that their trace vanishes.
We will use so-called canonical coordinates for the algebra which are simply the coefficients
in the Pauli basis. That is, we consider the Pauli basis elements multiplied with the
imaginary unit :math:`i`, except for the identity:

.. math::

    G_m \in \mathcal{P}^{(n)} = i \left\{I,X,Y,Z\right\}^n \setminus \{i I^n\}.

A Lie algebra element :math:`\Omega` can be written as

.. math::

    \Omega = \sum_{m=1}^d \theta_m G_m,\quad \theta_m \in \mathbb{R}

and those coefficients :math:`\theta` are precisely the canonical coordinates.
You may ask why we included the prefactor :math:`i` in the definition of :math:`G_m` and why we excluded
the identity (times :math:`i`). This was done to match the properties of :math:`\mathfrak{su}(N)`;
the prefactor makes the basis elements skew-Hermitian and the identity would not have a
vanishing trace. Indeed, one can check that the dimension of :math:`\mathfrak{su}(N)` is
:math:`4^n-1` and that there are :math:`4^n` Pauli words, so that one Pauli word — the identity — had to go
in any case... We can use the canonical coordinates of the algebra to express a *group element* in
:math:`\mathrm{SU}(N)` as well, and the ``qml.SpecialUnitary`` gate we will use is defined as

.. math::

    U(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \exp\left\{\sum_{m=1}^d \theta_m G_m \right\}.

The number of coordinates and Pauli words in :math:`\mathcal{P}^{(n)}` is :math:`d=4^n-1`.
Therefore, this will be the number of parameters that a single ``qml.SpecialUnitary`` gate acting on
:math:`n` qubits will take. For example, it takes just three parameters for a single qubit, which
is why :class:`~pennylane.Rot` and :class:`~pennylane.U3` take three parameters and may
produce *any* single-qubit rotation. It takes a modest 15 parameters for two qubits,
but it already requires 63 parameters for three qubits.

For unitaries generated by a single operator, i.e. of the form :math:`\exp(i\theta G)`,
there is a plethora of differentiation techniques that allow us to compute its derivative.
However, a standard parameter-shift rule, for example, will not do the job if there are
non-commuting terms :math:`G_m` in the multi-parameter gate :math:`U(\boldsymbol{\theta})` above.
So how *do* we compute the derivative?

Obtaining the gradient
----------------------

In variational quantum algorithms, we typically use the circuit to prepare a quantum state and
then we measure some observable :math:`H`. The resulting real-valued output is considered to be the
cost function :math:`C` that should be minimized. If we want to use gradient-based optimization for
this task, we need a method to compute the gradient :math:`\nabla C` in addition to the cost
function itself. As derived in the publication [#wiersema]_, this is possible on quantum hardware
for :math:`\mathrm{SU}(N)` gates as long as the gates themselves can be implemented.
The implementation in PennyLane follows the decomposition idea described in App. F3, but the
main text of [#wiersema]_ proposes an additional method that scales better in some scenarios
(the caveat being that this method requires additional gates to be available on the quantum hardware).
Here, we will focus on the former method.
We will not go through the entire derivation, but note the following key points:

- The gradient with respect to all :math:`d` parameters of an :math:`\mathrm{SU}(N)` gate can be
  computed using :math:`2d` auxiliary circuits. Each of the circuits contains one additional
  operation compared to the original circuit, namely a ``qml.PauliRot`` gate with rotation
  angles of :math:`\pm\frac{\pi}{2}`. Note that these Pauli rotations act on up to :math:`n`
  qubits.
- This differentiation method uses automatic differentiation during compilation and
  classical coprocessing steps, but is compatible with quantum hardware. For large :math:`n`,
  the classical processing steps can quickly become prohibitively expensive.
- The computed gradient is not an approximative technique but allows for an exact computation
  of the gradient on simulators. On quantum hardware, this leads to unbiased gradient
  estimators.

The implementation in PennyLane takes care of creating the additional circuits and evaluating
them, and with adequate post-processing we get the gradient :math:`\nabla C`.

Comparing gradient methods
--------------------------

Before we dive into using ``qml.SpecialUnitary`` in an optimization task, let's compare
a few methods to compute the gradient with respect to the parameters of such a gate.
In particular, we will look at a finite difference (FD) approach, the stochastic parameter-shift
rule, and the custom gradient method we described above.

For the first approach, we will use the standard central difference recipe given by

.. math::

    \partial_{\text{FD},\theta_j}C(\boldsymbol{\theta})
    =\left[C\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}+\frac{\delta}{2}\boldsymbol{e}_j\right)
    -C\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}-\frac{\delta}{2}\boldsymbol{e}_j\right)\right] / \delta.

Here, :math:`\delta` is a shift parameter that we need to choose and :math:`\boldsymbol{e}_j` is the
:math:`j`-th canonical basis vector, i.e. the all-zeros vector with a one in the
:math:`j`-th entry. This approach is agnostic to the differentiated function and does
not exploit its structure.

In contrast, the stochastic parameter-shift rule is a differentiation recipe developed particularly
for multi-parameter gates like the :math:`\mathrm{SU}(N)` gates [#banchi]_. It involves the
approximate evaluation of an integral by sampling *splitting times* :math:`\tau` and
evaluating an expression close to the non-stochastic parameter-shift rule for each sample.
For more details, also consider the
:doc:`demo on the stochastic parameter-shift rule </demos/tutorial_stochastic_parameter_shift>`.

So, let's dive into a toy example and explore the three gradient methods!
We start by defining a simple one-qubit circuit that contains a single :math:`\mathrm{SU}(2)`
gate and measures the expectation value of :math:`H=\frac{3}{5} Z - \frac{4}{5} Y`.
As ``qml.SpecialUnitary`` requires automatic differentiation subroutines even for the
hardware-ready derivative recipe, we will make use of JAX.

# three differentiation methods? We will not go into detail here, but refer
# to [#wiersema]_ to see how the custom differentiation rule proposed in the
# main text leads to the lowest mean squared error. For a single-qubit circuit
# similar to the one above, but with the single gate :math:`U(\boldsymbol{\theta})=\exp(iaX+ibY)`,

#
# As we can see, the custom :math:`\mathrm{SU}(N)` parameter-shift rule produces the
# gradient estimates with the smallest variance. For small values of the parameter
# :math:`b`, which is fixed for each panel, the custom shift rule and the stochastic
# shift rule approach the standard two-term parameter-shift rule, which would be exact
# for :math:`b=0`.
# The finite difference gradient shown here was obtained using the shift
# scale :math:`\delta=0.75`, as well. As we can see, this suppresses the variance down to
# a level comparable to those of the shift rule derivatives and this shift scale is a
# reasonable trade-off between the variance and the systematic error we observed earlier.
# As shown in App. F3 of [#wiersema]_, this scale is indeed close to the optimal choice
# if we were to compute the gradient with 100 shots per circuit.
#
# Comparing ansatz structures
# ---------------------------
#
# We discussed above that there are many circuit architectures available and that choosing
# a suitable ansatz is important but can be difficult. Here, we will compare a simple ansatz
# based on the ``qml.SpecialUnitary`` gate discussed above to other approaches that fully
# parametrize the special unitary group for the respective number of qubits.
# In particular, we will compare ``qml.SpecialUnitary`` to standard decompositions from the
# literature that parametrize :math:`\mathrm{SU}(N)` with elementary gates, as well as to a
# sequence of Pauli rotation gates that also allows us to create any special unitary.
# Let us start by defining the decomposition of a two-qubit unitary.
# We choose the decomposition, which is optimal but not unique, from [#vatan]_.
# The Pauli rotation sequence is available in PennyLane

#
#
# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# To summarize, in this tutorial we introduced ``qml.SpecialUnitary``, a multi-parameter
# gate that can act like *any* gate on the qubits it is applied to and that is constructed
# with Lie theory in mind. We discussed three methods of differentiating quantum circuits
# that use this gate, showing that a new custom parameter-shift rule presented in
# [#wiersema]_ is particularly suitable to produce unbiased gradient estimates with the
# lowest variance. Afterwards, we used this differentiation technique when comparing
# the performance of ``qml.SpecialUnitary`` to that of other gates that can act
# like *any* gate locally. For this, we ran a gradient-based optimization for a toy model
# Hamiltonian and found that ``qml.SpecialUnitary`` is particularly well-trainable, achieving
# lower energies significantly quicker than the other tested gates.

# There are still exciting questions to answer about ``qml.SpecialUnitary``: How can the
# custom parameter-shift rule be used for other gates, and what does the so-called
# *Dynamical Lie algebra* of these gates have to do with it? How can we implement
# the ``qml.SpecialUnitary`` gate on hardware? Is the unitary time evolution implemented
# by this gate special in a physical sense?
#
# The answers to some, but not all, of these questions can be found in [#wiersema]_.
# We are certain that there are many more interesting aspects of this gate to be uncovered!
# If you want to learn more, consider the other literature references below,
# as well as the documentation of :class:`~pennylane.SpecialUnitary`.

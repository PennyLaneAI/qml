If you looked at variational quantum algorithms before, maybe -- and in my experience
very likely -- you wondered why the chosen circuit ansatz looks the way it does.
In some cases there are good reasons for the choice of ansatz. For example one could
demand the circuit to be hardware compatible with respect to the used gate set and
the qubit connectivity, or one could set up a structure and parametrization that 
preserves particular symmetries. Other features that impact the choice of circuit
include trainability and expressibility.
While a number of best practices for ansatz design have been developed,
a lot is still unknown about the connection between circuit structures and the
resulting features. Therefore intuition often is at play as well, and a circuit
ansatz reported in the literature might just have turned out
to work particularly well for a given problem, or might fall into a "standard"
category of circuits.
One approach to make an ansatz generic and avoid arbitrary choices in
the circuit design is to perform the most general operations locally on a few qubits
and to chose only the sets of qubits the operations are applied to.

In this tutorial, you will learn about a particular quantum gate which can act like
*any* gate on the corresponding qubits by chosing the parameters accordingly.
We will then look at a custom differentiation rule for this gate, construct 
a simple ansatz, and use it in a toy minimization problem.

The special unitary group SU(N) and its Lie algebra
---------------------------------------------------

The gate we will look at is given by a specific parametrization of the special
unitary group :math:`SU(N)`, where :math:`N=2^n` is the Hilbert space dimension of the gate
for :math:`n` qubits. Mathematically, the group can be defined as the set of operators
or matrices that can be inverted by taking their adjoint (unitarity) and that have 
determinant :math:`1`. All gates acting on :math:`n` qubits are elements of :math:`SU(N)`
up to a global phase.

The group :math:`SU(N)` is a Lie group, and its associated Lie algebra via the exponential
map is :math:`\mathfrak{su}(N)`. For our purposes it will be sufficient to look at a matrix
representation of the algebra and we may write

.. math::

    \mathfrak{su}(N) = \{\Omega \in \mathbb{C}^{N\times N}| \Omega^\dagger=-\Omega, \Tr{\Omega}=0\}.

We will use so-called canonical coordinates for the algebra which are given by the coefficients
of an algebra element :math:`\Omega` in the Pauli basis (except for the identity, which does not
have trace zero, and with a prefactor :math:`i`):
    
.. math::

    \Omega &= \sum_{m=1}^d \theta_m G_m\\
    \theta_m &\in \mathbb{R}\\
    G_m &\in \mathcal{P}^{n} = i \left\{I,X,Y,Z\right\}^n \setminus \{i I^n\}.

This yields a parametrization for the group :math:`SU(N)` as well, and the ``qml.SpecialUnitary`` gate
we will use is given by

.. math::

    U(\bm{\theta}) = \exp\left\{\sum_{m=1}^d \theta_m G_m \right\}.

The number of coordinates and of Pauli words in :math:`\mathcal{P}^n` is :math:`d=4^n-1`.
Therefore, this will be the number of parameters a single ``qml.SpecialUnitary`` gate acting on
:math:`n` qubits will take. This means that it takes just ``3`` parameters for a single qubit and 
a moderate number of ``15`` parameters for two qubits, but already requires ``63`` parameters for
three qubits.

Obtaining the gradient
----------------------

In variational quantum algorithms, we typically use the circuit to prepare a quantum state and
then we measure some observable :math:`H`. The resulting real-valued output is considered as
cost function :math:`C` to be minimized. If we want to use gradient-based optimization for this task,
we need a method to compute the gradient :math:`\nabla C` in addition to the cost function itself.
As derived in the publication [#wiersema]_, this is possible on quantum hardware as long
as the :math:`SU(N)` gate itself can be implemented.
We will not go through the entire derivation, but note the following key points:

    #. The gradient with respect to all :math:`d` parameters of an :math:`SU(N)` gate can be computed
       using :math:`2d` auxiliary circuits. Each of the circuits contains one additional operation
       compared to the original circuit, namely a ``qml.PauliRot`` gate with rotation angles
       :math:`\pm\frac{\pi}{2}.
    #. The computed gradient is not an approximative technique but allows for exact gradient
       computation on simulators. On quantum hardware, this leads to unbiased gradient estimators.
    #. With ``qml.SpecialUnitary`` and its gradient we effectively implement a so-called
       Riemannian gradient flow on the respective qubits.

The implementation in PennyLane takes care of creating the additional circuits and evaluating
them, together with adequate post-processing into the gradient :math:`\nabla C`.

Comparing ansatz structures
---------------------------

We discussed above that there are many circuit architectures available and that choosing
a suitable ansatz can be difficult. Here we will compare a simple ansatz based on
the ``qml.SpecialUnitary`` gate discussed above to other approaches that fully parametrize
the special unitary group for the respective number of qubits.
In particular, we will compare ``qml.SpecialUnitary`` to standard decompositions from the
literature that parametrize :math:`SU(N)` with elementary gates, and to a sequence
of Pauli rotation gates that also allows to create any special unitary.
Let us start by defining the decompositions for one and two qubits, which are optimal in
their gate count, but not unique. For the two-qubit case we choose the decomposition
from [#vatan]_. The Pauli rotation sequence is available in PennyLane
via ``qml.ArbitraryUnitary`` and we will not need to implement it manually.


- explain that there are decompositions for arbitrary unitaries and introduce the generic decomposiiton for n=2 as well as the `ArbitraryUnitary` structure
- introduce one or two other ansatze with actually fewer parameters. 

Code block: code up all mentioned ansatze.

- introduce random Hamiltonian and experiment settings

code block: random Hamiltonian and settings

- discuss optimization: GradientDescent? Adam? LBFGSB?

code block: function that runs optimization
            run optimization

- announce result

code block: energy curves

- can we discuss anything about optimization curves?

Estimating properties of unknown quantum states is a key objective of quantum
information science and technology.
For example, one might want to check whether an apparatus prepares a particular target state,
or verify that an unknown system is entangled.
In principle, any unknown quantum state can be fully characterized by `quantum state
tomography <https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0302028.pdf>`_ [#Mauro2003]_.
However, this procedure requires accurate expectation values for a set of observables
whose size grows exponentially with the number of qubits.
A potential workaround for these scaling concerns is provided by the classical shadow approximation
introduced in `Predicting many properties of a quantum system from very few measurements
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08953.pdf>`_ [#Huang2020]_.

The approximation is an efficient protocol for constructing a *classical shadow*
representation of an unknown quantum state.
The classical shadow can be used to estimate properties such as
quantum state fidelity, expectation values of Hamiltonians, entanglement witnesses, and two-point correlators.

In this demo, we use PennyLane to obtain classical shadows of a quantum state prepared by
a quantum circuit, and use them to reconstruct the state and estimate expectation values of
observables.

# Constructing a Classical Shadow
# ###############################
#
# Classical shadow estimation relies on the fact that for a particular choice of measurement,
# we can efficiently store snapshots of the state that contain enough information to accurately
# predict linear functions of observables. Depending on what type of measurements we choose,
# we have an information-theoretic bound that allows us to control the precision of our estimator.
#
# Let us consider an :math:`n`-qubit quantum state :math:`\rho` (prepared by a circuit) and apply a random unitary
# :math:`U` to the state:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \rho \to U \rho U^\dagger.
#
# Next, we measure in the computational basis and obtain a bit string of outcomes :math:`|b\rangle = |0011\ldots10\rangle`.
# If the unitaries :math:`U` are chosen at random from a particular ensemble, then we can store the reverse operation
# :math:`U^\dagger |b\rangle\langle b| U` efficiently in classical memory.
# We call this a *snapshot* of the state.
# Moreover, we can view the average over these snapshots as a measurement channel:
#
# .. math::
#
#      \mathbb{E}\left[U^\dagger |b\rangle\langle b| U\right] = \mathcal{M}(\rho).
#
# If the ensemble of unitaries defines a tomographically complete set of measurements,
# we can invert the channel and reconstruct the state:
#
# .. math::
#
#      \rho = \mathbb{E}\left[\mathcal{M}^{-1}\left(U^\dagger |b\rangle\langle b| U \right)\right].
#
# If we apply the procedure outlined above :math:`N` times, then the collection of inverted snapshots
# is what we call the *classical shadow*
#
# .. math::
#
#      S(\rho,N) = \left\{\hat{\rho}_1= \mathcal{M}^{-1}\left(U_1^\dagger |b_1\rangle\langle b_1| U_1 \right)
#      ,\ldots, \hat{\rho}_N= \mathcal{M}^{-1}\left(U_N^\dagger |b_N\rangle\langle b_N| U_N \right)
#      \right\}.
#
# Note that the inverted channel is not physical, i.e., it is not completely postive and trace preserving (CPTP).
# However, this is of no concern to us, since all we care about is efficiently applying this inverse channel to the
# observed snapshots as a post-processing step.
#
# Since the shadow approximates :math:`\rho`, we can now estimate **any** observable with the empirical mean:
#
# .. math::
#
#      \langle O \rangle = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i \text{Tr}{\hat{\rho}_i O}.
#
# Note that the classical shadow is independent of the observables we want to estimate, :math:`S(\rho,N)` contains
# only information about the state!
#
# Furthermore, the authors of [#Huang2020]_ prove that with a shadow of size :math:`N`, we can predict :math:`M` arbitary linear functions
# :math:`\text{Tr}{O_1\rho},\ldots,\text{Tr}{O_M \rho}` up to an additive error :math:`\epsilon` if :math:`N\geq \mathcal{O}\left(\log{M} \max_i ||O_i||^2_{\text{shadow}}/\epsilon^2\right)`.
# The shadow norm :math:`||O_i||^2_{\text{shadow}}` again depends on the unitary ensemble that is chosen.
#
# Two different ensembles are considered for selecting the random unitaries :math:`U`:
#
# 1. Random :math:`n`-qubit Clifford circuits.
# 2. Tensor products of random single-qubit Pauli operators.
#
# Although ensemble 1 leads to the most powerful estimators, it comes with serious practical limitations
# since :math:`n^2 / \log(n)` entangling gates are required to sample the Clifford circuit. The snapshots of both ensembles
# can be stored efficiently using the `stabilizer formalism <https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9705052>`_ [#Gottesman1997]_.
# For the purposes of this demo we focus on ensemble 2, which is a more NISQ-friendly approach.
#
# This ensemble comes with a significant drawback: The shadow norm :math:`||O_i||^2_{\text{shadow}}`
# becomes dependent on the locality :math:`k` of the observables that we want to estimate
#
# .. math::
#
#      ||O_i||^2_{\text{shadow}} \leq 4^k ||O_i||_\infty^2.
#
# This is a serious limitation. Say that we want to estimate the single expectation value of a Pauli observable
# :math:`\langle X_1 \otimes X_2 \otimes \ldots \otimes X_n \rangle`. Estimating this from repeated measurements
# would require :math:`1/\epsilon^2` samples, whereas we would need an exponentially large shadow due to the :math:`4^n` appearing in the bound.
# Therefore, classical shadows based on Pauli measurements only offer an advantage when we have to measure a large number
# of observables with modest locality.
#
# We will now demonstrate how to obtain classical shadows using PennyLane.

# A classical shadow is a collection of :math:`N` individual snapshots :math:`\hat{\rho}_i`.

# 1. The quantum state :math:`\rho` is prepared with a circuit.
# 2. A unitary :math:`U` is randomly selected from the ensemble and applied to :math:`\rho`.
# 3. A computational basis measurement is performed.
# 4. The snapshot is recorded as the observed eigen value :math:`1,-1` for :math:`|0\rangle,|1\rangle`, respectively,
# and the index of the randomly selected unitary :math:`U`.

# Estimating Pauli Observables with Classical Shadows
# ###################################################
#
# We have confirmed that classical shadows can be used to reconstruct
# the state. However, the goal of classical shadows is not to perform full tomography, which takes
# an exponential amount of resources. Instead, we want to use the shadows to efficiently
# calculate linear functions of a quantum state. To do this, we write a function
# ``estimate_shadow_observable`` that takes in the previously constructed shadow
# :math:`S(\rho, N)=[\hat{\rho}_1,\hat{\rho}_2,\ldots,\hat{\rho}_N]`, and
# estimates any observable via a median of means estimation. This makes the estimator
# more robust to outliers and is required to formally prove the aforementioned theoretical
# bound. The procedure is simple: split up the shadow into :math:`K` equally sized chunks
# and estimate the mean for each of these chunks,
#
# .. math::
#
#      \langle O_{(k)}\rangle = \text{Tr}\{O \hat{\rho}_{(k)}\} \quad
#      \text{and} \quad \hat{\rho}_{(k)} = \frac{1}{ \lfloor N/K \rfloor }
#      \sum_{i=(k-1)\lfloor N/K \rfloor + 1}^{k \lfloor N/K \rfloor } \hat{\rho}_i.
#
# The median of means estimator is then simply the median of this set
#
# .. math::
#
#       \langle O\rangle = \text{median}\{\langle O_{(1)} \rangle,\ldots, \langle O_{(K)} \rangle \}.
#
# Note that the shadow bound has a failure probability :math:`\delta`. By choosing the number of splits :math:`K` to be
# suitably large, we can exponentially suppress this failure probability.
# Assume now that :math:`O=\bigotimes_j^n P_j`, where :math:`P_j \in \{I, X, Y, Z\}`.
# To efficiently calculate the estimator for :math:`O`, we look at a single snapshot outcome and plug in the inverse measurement channel:
#
# .. math::
#
#    \text{Tr}\{O\hat{\rho}_i\} &= \text{Tr}\{\bigotimes_{j=1}^n P_j (3U^{\dagger}_j|\hat{b}_j\rangle\langle\hat{b}_j|U_j-\mathbb{I})\}\\
#     &= \prod_j^n \text{Tr}\{ 3 P_j U^{\dagger}_j|\hat{b}_j\rangle\langle\hat{b}_j|U_j\}.
#
# Due to the orthogonality of the Pauli operators, this evaluates to :math:`\pm 3` if :math:`P_j` is the
# corresponding measurement basis :math:`U_j` and 0 otherwise. Hence if a single :math:`U_j` in the snapshot
# does not match the one in :math:`O`, the whole product evaluates to zero. As a result, calculating the mean estimator
# can be reduced to counting the number of exact matches in the shadow with the observable, and multiplying with the appropriate
# sign. Below, we develop the function ``estimate_shadow_obervable`` to estimate any observable given a classical shadow.

# To conclude, we have shown that classical shadows can be used to reconstruct quantum states and
# estimate expectation values of observables. This is but the tip of the iceberg of what is possible
# with this technique. In the original work [#Huang2020]_, the authors estimate fidelities,
# calculate entanglement witnesses even find a way to approximate the von Neumann entropy.
# These applications are beyond the scope of this demo, but they illustrate the potential power
# of classical shadows for the characterization of quantum systems.

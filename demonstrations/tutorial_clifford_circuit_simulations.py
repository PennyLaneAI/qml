Efficient Simulation of Clifford Circuits
=========================================

Classical simulation of quantum circuits doesn't always require an exponential amount of
computational resources. They can be performed efficiently if there exists a classical
description that enables evolving the quantum state by unitary operations and performing
measurements in a polynomial number of steps [#supremecy_exp1]_, [#supremecy_exp2]_. In this
tutorial, we take a deep dive into learning about Clifford circuits, which are known to be
efficiently simulable by classical computers and play an essential role in the practical
implementation of quantum computation. We will learn how to use PennyLane to simulate these
circuits scaling up to more than thousands of qubits. We also look at the ability to
decompose quantum circuits into a set of universal quantum gates comprising Clifford gates.


Clifford Group and Clifford Gates
---------------------------------

In classical computation, one can define a universal set of logic gate operations such as
``{AND, NOT, OR}`` that can be used to perform any boolean function. A similar analogue
in quantum computation is to have a set of quantum gates that can approximate any unitary
transformation up to the desired accuracy. One such universal quantum gate set is the
:math:`\textrm{Clifford + T}` set, ``{H, S, CNOT, T}``, where the gates ``H``, ``S``, and
``CNOT`` are the generators of the *Clifford group*. The elements of this group are
called *Clifford gates*, which transform *Pauli* words to *Pauli* words under
`conjugation <https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Conjugation.html>`__. This means an
:math:`n`-qubit unitary :math:`C` belongs to the Clifford group if the conjugates
:math:`C P C^{\dagger}` are also Pauli words for all :math:`n`-qubit Pauli words :math:`P`.
We can see this ourselves by conjugating the Pauli `X` operation with the elements of
the universal set defined above:

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/clifford_simulation/pauli-normalizer.jpeg
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :target: javascript:void(0)

Clifford gates can be obtained by combining the generators of the Clifford group along
with their inverses and include the following quantum operations, which are all
supported in PennyLane:

1. Single-qubit Pauli gates: :class:`~.pennylane.I`, :class:`~.pennylane.X`,
   :class:`~.pennylane.Y`, and :class:`~.pennylane.Z`.
2. Other single-qubit gates: :class:`~.pennylane.S` and :class:`~.pennylane.Hadamard`.
3. The two-qubit ``controlled`` Pauli gates: :class:`~.pennylane.CNOT`,
   :class:`~.pennylane.CY`, and :class:`~.pennylane.CZ`.
4. Other two-qubit gates: :class:`~.pennylane.SWAP` and :class:`~.pennylane.ISWAP`.
5. Adjoints of the above gate operations via :func:`~pennylane.adjoint`.

| Each of these gates can be uniquely described by how they transform the Pauli words. For
  example, ``Hadamard`` conjugates :math:`X` to :math:`Z` and :math:`Z` to :math:`X`.
  Similarly, ``ISWAP`` acting on a subspace of qubits `i` and `j` conjugates :math:`X_{i}`
  to :math:`-Z_{i}Y_{j}` and :math:`Z_{i}` to :math:`Z_{j}`. These transformations can
  be presented in tabulated forms called *Clifford tableaus*, as shown below:

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/clifford_simulation/clifford_tableaus.jpeg
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :target: javascript:void(0)


Clifford circuits and Stabilizer Tableaus
-----------------------------------------

The quantum circuits that consist only of Clifford gates are called *Clifford circuits*
or, more generally, Clifford group circuits. Moreover, the Clifford circuits that
also have single-qubit measurements are known as *stabilizer circuits*. The states
such circuits can evolve to are known as the *stabilizer states*. For example, the
following figure shows the single-qubit stabilizer states:

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/clifford_simulation/clifford-octahedron.jpg
  :align: center
  :width: 40%
  :target: javascript:void(0)
  :alt: The octahedron in the Bloch sphere.

  The octahedron in the Bloch sphere defines the states accessible via single-qubit Clifford gates.

These types of circuits represent extremely important classes of quantum circuits in the
context of quantum error correction and measurement-based quantum computation [#mbmqc_2009]_.
More importantly, they can be efficiently simulated classically, according to the
*Gottesman-Knill* theorem, which states that any :math:`n`-qubit Clifford circuit with
:math:`m` Clifford gates can be simulated in time :math:`poly(m, n)` on a probabilistic
classical computer.

There are several ways for representing :math:`n`-qubit stabilizer states :math:`|\psi\rangle`
and tracking their evolution with a :math:`poly(n)` number of bits. The `CHP` (CNOT-Hadamard-Phase)
formalism, also called the *phase-sensitive* formalism, is one of these methods, where one
efficiently describes the state using a *Stabilizer tableau* structure based on its
``stabilizer`` set :math:`\mathcal{S}`. The `stabilizers`, represented by the elements ``s`` in
:math:`\mathcal{S}`, are n-qubit Pauli words that have the state :math:`|\psi\rangle` as their
:math:`+1` eigenstate, i.e., :math:`s|\psi\rangle = |\psi\rangle`,
:math:`\forall s \in \mathcal{S}`. These are often viewed as virtual ``Z`` operators, while their
conjugates, termed `destabilizers` (``d``), correspond to virtual ``X`` operators, forming a
similar set referred to as ``destabilizer`` set :math:`\mathcal{D}`.

The stabilizer tableau for an :math:`n`-qubit state is made of binary variables representing
the Pauli words for the ``generators`` of stabilizer :math:`\mathcal{S}` and destabilizer
:math:`\mathcal{D}`and their ``phases``. These are generally arranged as the following
tabulated structure [#lowrank_2019]_:

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/clifford_simulation/stabilizer-tableau.jpeg
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :target: javascript:void(0)

Here, the first and last :math:`n` rows represent the generators :math:`\mathcal{d}_i`
and :math:`\mathcal{s}_i` as `check vectors
<https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/latest/code/api/pennylane.pauli.binary_to_pauli.html>`__,
respectively, and they generate the entire Pauli group :math:`\mathcal{P}_n` together.
The last column contains the binary variable `r` corresponding to the phase of each
generator and gives the sign (:math:`\pm`) for the Pauli word that represents them.

For evolving the state, i.e., replicating the application of the Clifford gates on the state,
we update each generator and the corresponding phase according to the Clifford tableau
described above [#aaronson-gottesman2004]_. In the :ref:`simulation-section` section,
we will expand on this in greater detail.


Clifford Simulations in PennyLane
---------------------------------

PennyLane has a ``default.clifford``
`device <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/latest/code/api/pennylane.devices.default_clifford.html>`_
that enables efficient simulation of large-scale Clifford circuits. The device uses the
`stim <https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim>`__ simulator [#stim]_ as an underlying backend and
can be used to run Clifford circuits in the same way we run any other regular circuits
in the PennyLane ecosystem. Let's look at an example that constructs a Clifford circuit and
performs several measurements.

# Simulating Stabilizer Tableau

######################################################################
# The process worked as anticipated! So, to track and compute the evolved state, one only needs
# to know the transformation rules for each gate operation described by their tableau. This makes

# Clifford + T Decomposition
# --------------------------
#

######################################################################
# Finally, you might wonder if there's a programmatic way to determine whether a given circuit
# is a Clifford or a stabilizer circuit, or which gates in the circuit are non-Clifford
# operations. While the ``default.clifford`` device internally attempts this by decomposing
# each gate operation into the Clifford basis, one can also do this independently
# on their own. In PennyLane, any quantum circuit can be decomposed in a universal basis
# using the :func:`~pennylane.clifford_t_decomposition`. This transform, under the hood,
# decomposes the entire circuit up to a desired operator norm error :math:`\epsilon \geq 0`
# using :func:`~pennylane.ops.sk_decomposition` that employs an iter-recursive variant
# of the original Solovay-Kitaev algorithm described in
# `Dawson and Nielsen (2005) <https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0505030>`__.
# Let's see this in action for the following two-qubit parameterized circuit:
#

dev = qml.device("default.qubit")
@qml.qnode(dev)
def original_circuit(x, y):
    qml.RX(x, 0)
    qml.CNOT([0, 1])
    qml.RY(y, 0)
    return qml.probs()

x, y = np.pi / 2, np.pi / 4
unrolled_circuit = qml.transforms.clifford_t_decomposition(original_circuit)

qml.draw_mpl(unrolled_circuit, decimals=2, style="pennylane")(x, y)
plt.show()

######################################################################
# In the *unrolled* quantum circuit, we can see that the non-Clifford rotation gates
# :class:`~.pennylane.RX` and :class:`~.pennylane.RY` at the either side of
# :class:`~.pennylane.CNOT` has been replaced by the sequence of single-qubit Clifford and
# :math:`\textrm{T}` gates, which depend on their parameter values. In order to ensure that the
# performed decomposition is correct, we can compare the measurement results of the unrolled
# and original circuits.
#

original_probs, unrolled_probs = original_circuit(x, y), unrolled_circuit(x, y)
assert qml.math.allclose(original_probs, unrolled_probs, atol=1e-3)

######################################################################
# Ultimately, one can use this decomposition to perform some basic resource analysis for
# fault-tolerant quantum computation, such as calculating the number of non-Clifford
# :math:`\textrm{T}` gate operations as shown below. Generally, increase in the number of
# such gates escalates the computational resource demands because the stabilizer formalism
# can no longer be directly applied to evolve the circuit. This is due to their influence
# on the fault-tolerant thresholds for error correction codes, as outlined in the
# `Eastin-Knill <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastin%E2%80%93Knill_theorem>`__ theorem.

# Conclusion
# ----------
#

######################################################################
# Stabilizer circuits are an important class of quantum circuits that are used
# in quantum error correction and benchmarking the performance of quantum hardware.
# The ``default.clifford`` device in PennyLane enables efficient classical simulations
# of large-scale Clifford circuits and their use for these purposes.
# The device allows one to obtain the Tableau form of the quantum state and supports a wide
# range of essential analytical and statistical measurements such as expectation values,
# samples, entropy-based results and even classical shadow-based results. Additionally,
# it supports finite-shot execution with noise channels that add single or
# multi-qubit Pauli noise, such as depolarization and flip errors. PennyLane also
# provides a functional way to decompose and compile a circuit into a universal basis,
# which can ultimately enable the simulation of near-Clifford circuits.

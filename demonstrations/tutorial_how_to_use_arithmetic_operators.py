How-to use Quantum Arithmetic Operators
=======================================

Classical computers handle arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation with ease. 
For instance, you can multiply large numbers on your phone in milliseconds!

Quantum computers can handle these operations too, but their true value lies beyond basic calculations. Quantum arithmetic plays a crucial role in more advanced quantum algorithms, 
serving as fundamental building blocks in their design and execution. For example:

1. In Shor's algorithm quantum arithmetic is crucial for performing modular exponentiation [#shor_exp]_. 

2. Grover's algorithm might need to use quantum arithmetic to construct oracles, as shown in `this related demo <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qft_arithmetics/>`_.

3. Loading data or preparing initial states on a quantum computer often requires several quantum arithmetic operations [#sanders]_.

With PennyLane, you will see how easy it is to build these operations as subroutines for your quantum algorithms!

InPlace and OutPlace arithmetic operations
------------------------------------------
Let's begin by defining the terms "Inplace" and "Outplace" in the context of arithmetic operators. 
Inplace operators, like the :class:`~.pennylane.Adder` and :class:`~.pennylane.Multiplier`, directly modify the original quantum state by updating a 
specific register's state. In contrast, Outplace operators, such as the :class:`~.pennylane.OutAdder` and :class:`~.pennylane.OutMultiplier`, 
combine multiple states and store the result in a new register, leaving the original states unchanged. Both kind of operators are
illustrated in the following figure:

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/how_to_use_arithmetic_operators/in_outplace.png
  :align: center
  :width: 90%

In quantum computing, all arithmetic operations are inherently `modular <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic>`_. 
The default behavior in PennyLane is to perform operations modulo :math:`2^n`, 
where :math:`n` is the number of wires in the register. For example, if :math:`n=6`, the result of adding 32 and 43 is 11, 
because the sum is calculated as :math:`(32 + 43) = 75`, which is then reduced to :math:`75 \mod 64 = 11` (since :math:`2^6 = 64`). 
That means that quantum registers of :math:`n` wires can  represent numbers up to :math:`2^n`. 
However, users can specify a custom value smaller than this default. It's important to keep this modular behavior 
in mind when working with quantum arithmetic, as using 
too few qubits in a quantum register could lead to overflow issues. We will come back to this point later. 

Addition operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two addition operators in PennyLane: the :class:`~.pennylane.Adder` and the :class:`~.pennylane.OutAdder`.

The :class:`~.pennylane.Adder` performs an Inplace operation, adding an integer value :math:`k` to the state of the wires :math:`|w \rangle`. It is defined as:

.. math::

   \text{Adder}(k) |w \rangle = | w+k \rangle.

On the other hand, the :class:`~.pennylane.OutAdder` performs an Outplace operation, where the states of two 
wires, :math:`|x \rangle` and :math:`|y \rangle` are 
added together and the result is stored in a third register:

.. math::

   \text{OutAdder} |x \rangle |y \rangle |0 \rangle = |x \rangle |y \rangle |x + y \rangle.

To implement these operators in Pennylane, the first step is to define the `registers of wires <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_how_to_use_registers/>`_
we will work with. Note that we need to define the ``work_wires`` register to implement the :class:`~.pennylane.Multiplier` operator.

# Multiplication  operators
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# There are two multiplication operators in PennyLane: the :class:`~.pennylane.Multiplier` and the :class:`~.pennylane.OutMultiplier`.

# Applying a polynomial into a quantum computer
# --------------------------------------------
#
# Now that you are familiar with these operations, let's take it a step further and see how we can use them for something more complicated. 
# We will explore how to implement a polynomial function on a quantum computer using basic arithmetic.
# In particular, we will take as an example the function :math:`f(x,y)= 4 + 3xy + 5 x+ 3 y` where the variables :math:`x` and :math:`y`
# are integer values. Therefore, the operator we want to build is:
#
# .. math::
# 
#    U|x\rangle |y\rangle |0\rangle = |x\rangle |y\rangle |4 + 3xy + 5x + 3y\rangle.
#
# We will show how to implement this circuit in two different ways: first, by concatenating simple modular arithmetic operators,
# and finally, using the :class:`~.pennylane.OutPoly` operator.
#
# Concatenating arithmetic operations
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Let's start by defining the arithmetic operations to apply the function :math:`f(x,y) = 4 + 3xy + 5x + 3y` into a quantum state.
#
# First, we need to define a function that will add the term :math:`3xy` to the output register. We will use
# the :class:`~.pennylane.Multiplier` and :class:`~.pennylane.OutMultiplier` operators for this. Also, we will employ the
# adjoint function to undo certain multiplications and clean up the input registers after performing the operations,
# since :math:`U` does not modify the input registers.

def adding_3xy():
    # |x> --->  |3x>
    qml.Multiplier(3, wires["x"], work_wires=wires["work_wires"])

    # |3x>|y>|0> ---> |3x>|y>|3xy>
    qml.OutMultiplier(wires["x"], wires["y"], wires["output"])

    # We return the x-register to its original value using the adjoint operation
    # |3x>|y>|3xy>  ---> |x>|y>|3xy>
    qml.adjoint(qml.Multiplier)(3, wires["x"], work_wires=wires["work_wires"])

######################################################################
# Then we need to add the term :math:`5x + 3y` to the output register, which can be done by using the
# :class:`~.pennylane.Multiplier` and :class:`~.pennylane.OutAdder` operators.

def adding_5x_3y():

    # |x>|y> --->  |5x>|3y>
    qml.Multiplier(5, wires["x"], work_wires=wires["work_wires"])
    qml.Multiplier(3, wires["y"], work_wires=wires["work_wires"])

    # |5x>|3y>|0> --->  |5x>|3y>|5x + 3y>
    qml.OutAdder(wires["x"], wires["y"], wires["output"])

    # We return the x and y registers to its original value using the adjoint operation
    # |5x>|3y>|5x + 3y> --->  |x>|y>|5x + 3y>
    qml.adjoint(qml.Multiplier)(5, wires["x"], work_wires=wires["work_wires"])
    qml.adjoint(qml.Multiplier)(3, wires["y"], work_wires=wires["work_wires"])

######################################################################
# Now we can combine all these circuits to implement the transformation by the polynomial  :math:`f(x,y)= 4 + 3xy + 5 x+ 3 y`.

@qml.qnode(dev)
def circuit(x,y):

    product_basis_state(x, y)      #    |x> |y> |0>
    qml.Adder(4, wires["output"])  #    |x> |y> |4>
    adding_3xy()                   #    |x> |y> |4 + 3xy>
    adding_5x_3y()                 #    |x> |y> |4 + 3xy + 5x + 3y>

    return qml.sample(wires=wires["output"])

print(circuit(x=1,y=4), " ---> ", state_to_decimal(circuit(x=1,y=4)))

######################################################################
# Cool, we get the correct result :math:`f(1,4)=33`.
#
# At this point, it's interesting to consider what would happen if we had chosen a smaller number of wires for the output.
# For instance, if we had selected one less wire, we would have obtained the result :math:`33 \mod 2^5 = 1`.

wires = qml.registers({"x": 4, "y": 4, "output": 5,"work_wires": 4})

######################################################################
# With one less wire, we get :math:`1`, just like we predicted. Remember, we are working with modular arithmetic!
#
# Using OutPoly
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# There is a more direct method to apply polynomial transformations in PennyLane: 
# using :class:`~.pennylane.OutPoly`. 
# This operator automatically takes care of all the arithmetic under the hood. 
# Let's check out how to apply a function like :math:`f(x, y)` using :class:`~.pennylane.OutPoly`.
#
# We will start by explicitly defining our function:

def f(x, y):
   return 4 + 3*x*y + 5*x + 3*y

######################################################################
# Now, we create a quantum circuit using :class:`~.pennylane.OutPoly`.

######################################################################

   return qml.sample(wires = wires["output"])

print(circuit_with_Poly(x=1,y=4), " ---> ", state_to_decimal(circuit_with_Poly(x=1,y=4)))

######################################################################
# You can decide, depending on the problem you are tackling, whether to go for the versatility 
# of defining your own arithmetic operations or the convenience of using the :class:`~.pennylane.OutPoly` function.

# Conclusion

# Understanding and implementing quantum arithmetic is a key step toward unlocking the full potential

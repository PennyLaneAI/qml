r"""Learning shallow quantum circuits with local inversions and circuit sewing
==============================================================================

In a recent paper `Learning shallow quantum circuits <https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10095>`_ [#Huang]_, Huang et al
introduce and prove performance bounds on efficient algorithms to learn constant depth circuits.
At the heart of the paper lie local inversions that locally undo a quantum circuit, as well as a circuit "sewing"
technique that lets one construct a global inversion from those.
We are going to review these new concepts and showcase them with an implementation in PennyLane.

Introduction
------------

Shallow, constant depth quantum circuits are provably powerful [#Bravyi]_.
At the same time, they are known to be difficult to train [#Anschuetz]_.
The authors of [#Huang]_ tackle the question of whether or not shallow circuits are efficiently learnable.


Given some unknown unitary circuit :math:`U`, learning the circuit constitutes finding a unitary :math:`V` that faithfully resembles :math:`U`'s action.
This can be either fully performing the same operation (:math:`U V^\dagger = 1`) or resembling the action on a fixed input state
(:math:`U |\phi\rangle = V |\phi\rangle`, where often :math:`|\phi\rangle = |0^{\otimes n}\rangle`).
The authors go through both scenarios with different levels of restrictions on the allowed gate set and locality of the target circuit :math:`U`.
In this demo, we are mainly going to focus on learning the action on :math:`|0^{\otimes n}\rangle`, i.e. :math:`U |0^{\otimes}\rangle = V |0^{\otimes}\rangle`.


At the heart of the solutions to all these scenarios lies the use of local inversions that undo the effect of the unitary, 
and sewing them together to form a global inversion.

Local Inversions
----------------

A local inversion is a unitary circuit that locally disentangles one qubit after a previous, different unitary entangled them. Let us 
make an explicit example in PennyLane after some boilerplate imports. Let us look at a very shallow unitary circuit
:math:`U^\text{test} = \text{CNOT}_{(0, 1)}\text{CNOT}_{(2, 3)}\text{CNOT}_{(1, 2)} H^{\otimes n}`.

#
# Local inversions are not unique and finding one is easier than finding global inversions.
# But constructing a global inversion from all possible local inversions is highly non-trivial
# (as it constitutes a variant of the `quantum marginal problem <https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1085>`_).
# However, the circuit sewing technique introduced in [#Huang]_ lets us circumvent that problem and construct
# a global inversion from just a single local inversion per qubit.
#
# To do that, we construct the other local inversions in the same way as before by just following 
# back the light-cones of the respective qubits. In general these would have to be learned, more on that later. Here we just
# reverse-engineer them from knowing :math:`U^\text{test}`.

# Circuit Sewing
# --------------
#
# So how does knowing local inversions :math:`\{V_0, V_1, V_2, V_3\}` help us with solving the original goal of finding a global inversion :math:`U V = \mathbb{1}`?
# The authors introduce a clever trick that they coin `circuit sewing`. It works by swapping out the decoupled qubit with an ancilla register and restoring ("repairing") the unitary on the remaining wires. 
# Let us walk through this process step by step.
#
# We already saw how to decouple qubit :math:`0` in ``local_inversion()`` above. We continue by swapping out
# the decoupled wire with an ancilla qubit and "repairing" the circuit by applying :math:`V^\dagger_0`.
# (This is called "repairing" because :math:`V_1` can now decouple qubit 1, which would not be possible in general without that step.)
# We label all ancilla wires by ``[n + 0, n + 1, .. 2n-1]`` to have an easy 1-to-1 correspondence and we see that qubit ``1`` is successfully decoupled.
# For completeness, we also check that the swapped out qubit (now moved to wire ``n + 0``) is decoupled still.

# Numerical experiment
# --------------------
#
# The actual learning in this procedure happens in obtaining the local inversions :math:`\{V_0, V_1, V_2, V_3\}`.
# The paper relies on existence proofs from gate synthesis [#Shende]_ and suggests brute-force searching via enumerate-and-test to find suitable :math:`\{V_i\}`.
# The idea is to essentially take a big enough set of possible :math:`\{V_i\}` and post-select those that fulfill 
# :math:`||V^\dagger_i U^\dagger P_i U V_i - P_i|| < \epsilon` for :math:`P_i \in \{X, Y, Z\}`, which the authors 
# show suffices as a criterium to have an approximate local inversion.
#
# Instead of doing that, let us here look at an explicit example by constructing a target unitary of some structure and a variational Ansatz for 
# the local inversions that has a different structure. There are many ways to obtain local inversions, this is just one we find more convenient.
#

#
# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# We saw how one can construct a global inversion from sewing together local inversions. This is a powerful new technique 
# that may find applications in different domains of quantum computing.
# The technique cleverly circumvents the 
# quantum marginal problem of constructing a global inversion from local ones compatible with each other.
#
# The authors use this technique to prove that constant depth quantum circuits are learnable (i.e. can be reconstructed) in a variety of different scenarios.
#
# .. note::
#     We mainly focussed on the case of constructing :math:`V^\text{sew}` such that :math:`V^\text{sew} U |0^{\otimes n}\rangle = |0^{\otimes n}\rangle` as it already
#     nicely captures the main technical method that is circuit sewing. This is different to learning the full unitary, i.e. :math:`V` such that :math:`U V = 1`.
#
#     For this, the circuit sewing works in the exact same way. The main difference is that the local inversions are now full inversions in the sense of
#     :math:`\text{tr}_{\neq 0}\left[V_i U\right] = \mathbb{1}_i` (whereas before we just had :math:`V_i U |0^{\otimes n}\rangle = |0^{\otimes n}\rangle`, which is a simpler case).
#     The authors show that a sufficient condition for full inversion is achieved by minimizing
#
#     .. math:: \sum_{P\in \{X, Y, Z\}} ||V^\dagger_i U^\dagger P_i U V_i - P_i ||.
#
#     In the paper, the authors suggest to brute-force search the whole space of possible :math:`V_i` and post-select those for which the distance to :math:`P_i` is small.
#     The terms are evaluated by randomly sampling input (product) states :math:`|\phi_j\rangle` and computing expectation values of :math:`\langle \phi_j | V^\dagger_i U^\dagger P_i U V_i |\phi_j\rangle`.
#     In particular, samples for all possible candidates of :math:`V_i` are generated.
#     Another possibility is to perform state tomography of the single qubit states and compare that with the input state.
#     Either way, the circuit sewing after obtaining the learned local inversions is the same as described above.

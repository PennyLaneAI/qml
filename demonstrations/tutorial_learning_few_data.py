In this tutorial, we dive into the generalization capabilities of quantum machine learning models.
For the example of a `Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) <https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/qcnn.html>`_, we show how its generalization error behaves as a
function of the number of training samples. This demo is based on the paper
*"Generalization in quantum machine learning from few training data"*. by Caro et al. [#CaroGeneralization]_.

What is generalization in (Q)ML?
---------------------------------
When optimizing a machine learning model, be it classical or quantum, we aim to maximize its performance over the data
distribution of interest (e.g., images of cats and dogs). However, in practice, we are limited to a finite amount of
data, which is why it is necessary to reason about how our model performs on new, previously unseen data. The difference
between the model's performance on the true data distribution and the performance estimated from our training data is
called the *generalization error*, and it indicates how well the model has learned to generalize to unseen data.
Generalization can be seen as a manifestation of the bias-variance trade-off; models that
perfectly fit the training data admit a low bias at the cost of a higher variance, and hence typically perform poorly on unseen
test data. In the classical machine learning community, this trade-off has been extensively
studied and has led to optimization techniques that favour generalization, for example, by regularizing models via
their variance [#NamkoongVariance]_.
Below, we see a canoncial example of this trade-off, with a model having low bias, but high variance
and therefore high generalization error. The low variance model, on the other hand, has a higher 
bias but generalizes better.

Let us now dive deeper into generalization properties of quantum machine learning (QML) models. We start by describing
the typical data processing pipeline of a QML model. A classical data input :math:`x` is first encoded in a quantum
state via a mapping :math:`x \mapsto \rho(x)`. This encoded state is then processed through a quantum
channel :math:`\rho(x) \mapsto \mathcal{E}_\alpha(\rho(x))` with learnable parameters :math:`\alpha`. Finally, a measurement is performed on the resulting state
to get the final prediction. Now, the goal is to minimize the expected loss over the data-generating distribution
:math:`P`, indicating how well our model performs on new data. Mathematically, for a loss function :math:`\ell`, the
expected loss, denoted by :math:`R`, is given by

.. math:: R(\alpha) = \mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\sim P}[\ell(\alpha;\,x,\,y)]

where :math:`x` are the features, :math:`y` are the labels, and :math:`P` is their joint distribution.
In practice, as the joint distribution :math:`P` is generally unknown, this quantity has to be 
estimated from a finite amount of data. Given a training set :math:`S = \{(x_i,\,y_i)\}_{i=1}^N` 
with :math:`N` samples, we estimate the performance of our QML model by calculating the 
average loss over the training set

.. math:: R_S(\alpha) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \ell(\alpha;\,x_i,\,y_i),

which is referred to as the training loss and is an unbiased estimate of :math:`R(\alpha)`. This is only a proxy
to the true quantity of interest :math:`R(\alpha)`, and their difference is called the generalization error

.. math:: \mathrm{gen}(\alpha) =  R(\alpha) - \hat{R}_S(\alpha),

which is the quantity that we explore in this tutorial. Keeping in mind the bias-variance trade-off, one would expect
that more complex models, i.e. models with a larger number of parameters, achieve a lower error on the training data
but a higher generalization error. Having more training data, on the other hand, leads to a better approximation of the
true expected loss and hence a lower generalization error. This intuition is made precise in Ref. [#CaroGeneralization]_, 
where it is shown that :math:`\mathrm{gen}(\alpha)` roughly scales as :math:`\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T / N})`, where :math:`T`
is the number of parametrized gates and :math:`N` is the number of training samples.

# Generalization bounds for QML models
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# As hinted at earlier, we expect the generalization error to depend both on the richness of the model class, as well as
# on the amount of training data available. As a first result, the authors of Ref. [#CaroGeneralization]_ found that for
# a QML model with at most :math:`T` parametrized local quantum channels, the generalization error depends on :math:`T`
# and :math:`N` according to
#
# .. math:: \mathrm{gen}(\alpha) \sim \mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{T\log T}{N}}\right).
#
# We see that this scaling is in line with our intuition that the generalization error scales inversely with the number
# of training samples and increases with the number of parametrized gates. However, as is the case for
# `quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) <https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/qcnn.html>`_, it is possible to get a more fine-grained bound by including knowledge on the number of gates :math:`M` which have been reused (i.e. whose parameters are shared across wires). Naively, one could suspect that the generalization error scales as
# :math:`\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{MT/N})` by directly applying the above result (and where
# :math:`\tilde{\mathcal{O}}` includes logarithmic factors). However, the authors of Ref. [#CaroGeneralization]_ found
# that such models actually adhere to the better scaling
#
# .. math:: \mathrm{gen}(\alpha) \sim \mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{T\log MT}{N}}\right).
#
# With this, we see that for QCNNs to have a generalization error :math:`\mathrm{gen}(\alpha)\leq\epsilon`, we need a
# training set of size :math:`N \sim T \log MT / \epsilon^2`. For the special case of QCNNs, we can explicitly connect
# the number of samples needed for good generalization to the system size :math:`n` since these models
# use :math:`\mathcal{O}(\log(n))` independently parametrized gates, each of which is used at most :math:`n` times [#CongQuantumCNN]_.
# Putting the pieces together, we find that a training set of size
#
# .. math::  N \sim \mathcal{O}(\mathrm{poly}(\log n))
#
# is sufficient for the generalization error to be bounded by :math:`\mathrm{gen}(\alpha) \leq \epsilon`.
# In the next part of this tutorial, we will illustrate this result by implementing a QCNN to classify different
# digits in the classical ``digits`` dataset. Before that, we set up our QCNN.

# Quantum convolutional neural networks
# ------------------------------------
# Before we start building a QCNN, let us briefly review the idea of classical CNNs, which have shown
# tremendous success in tasks like image recognition, recommender systems, and sound classification, to name a few.
# For a more in-depth explanation of CNNs, we highly recommend `chapter 9 <https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/convnets.html>`_
# in [#DLBook]_.
# Classical CNNs are a family of neural networks which make use of convolutions and pooling operations to
# insert an inductive bias, favouring invariances to spatial transformations like translations, rotations, and scaling.
# A *convolutional layer* consists of a small kernel (a window) that sweeps over a 2D array representation of an image and extracts local
# information while sharing parameters across the spatial dimensions. In addition to the convolutional layers,
# one typically uses pooling layers to reduce the size of the input and to provide a mechanism for summarizing
# information from a neighbourhood of values in the input. On top of reducing dimensionality, these types of layers have the advantage
# of making the model more agnostic to certain transformations like scaling and rotations.
# These two types of layers are applied repeatedly in an alternating manner as shown in the figure below.

# To construct a convolutional and pooling layer in a quantum circuit, we will
# follow the QCNN construction proposed in [#CongQuantumCNN]_. The former layer
# will extract local correlations, while the latter allows reducing the dimensionality
# of the feature vector. In a quantum circuit, the convolutional layer, consisting of a kernel swept
# along the entire image, is a two-qubit unitary that correlates neighbouring
# qubits.  As for the pooling layer, we will use a conditioned single-qubit unitary that depends
# on the measurement of a neighboring qubit. Finally, we use a *dense layer* that entangles all
# qubits of the final state using an all-to-all unitary gate as shown in the figure below.

# The key takeaway of this work is that some quantum learning 
# models can achieve high-fidelity predictions using a few training data points. 
# We implemented a model known as the quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) using PennyLane 
# for a binary classification task. Using six qubits, we have trained the QCNN to distinguish 
# between handwritten digits of :math:`0`'s and :math:`1`'s. With :math:`80` samples, we have 
# achieved a model with accuracy greater than :math:`97\%` in :math:`100` training epochs. 
# Furthermore, we have compared the test and train accuracy of this model for a different number of 
# training samples and found the scaling of the generalization error agrees with the theoretical 
# bounds obtained in [#CaroGeneralization]_.

In this tutorial, we investigate using a stochastic optimizer called
the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm to optimize quantum
circuits. This optimizer is built into PennyLane as :class:`~pennylane.SPSAOptimizer`.
SPSA is a technique that involves approximating the gradient of a
quantum circuit without having to compute it exactly.

This demonstration shows how the SPSA optimizer performs on the following tasks,
compared to a gradient descent optimization:

1. A simple task on a sampling device,
2. The variational quantum eigensolver on a simulated hardware device.

Throughout the demo, we show results obtained with SPSA and with gradient
descent and also compare the number of executed circuits required to complete
each optimization.

Background
----------

In PennyLane, quantum gradients on hardware are commonly computed using
`parameter-shift rules <https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/parameter_shift.html>`_.
Computing quantum gradients involves evaluating the partial derivative of the quantum
function with respect to every free parameter. These partial derivatives are then used
to apply the chain rule to compute the gradient of the quantum circuit. For qubit
operations that are generated by one of the Pauli matrices, each partial
derivative computation will involve two quantum circuit evaluations with a
positive and a negative shift in the parameter values.

As there are two circuit evaluations for each free parameter, the number of
overall quantum circuit executions for computing a quantum gradient can be expected
to scale as :math:`O(p)`  with the number of free parameters :math:`p`.
This scaling can be very costly for optimization tasks with many
free parameters. For the overall optimization this scaling means we need
:math:`O(pn)` quantum circuit evaluations, where :math:`n` is the number of
optimization steps taken.

Fortunately, there are certain optimization techniques that offer an
alternative to computing the gradients of quantum circuits. One such technique
is called the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA)
algorithm [#spall_overview]_. SPSA is an optimization method that involves
*approximating* the gradient of the cost function at each iteration step. This
technique requires only two quantum circuit executions per iteration step,
regardless of the number of free parameters. Therefore the overall number of
circuit executions would be :math:`O(n')` where :math:`n'` is the number of
optimization steps taken when using SPSA. This technique is also considered
robust against noise, making it a great optimization method in the NISQ era.

In this demo, you'll learn how the SPSA algorithm works, and how to apply it in
PennyLane to compute gradients of quantum circuits. You'll also see it in action
using noisy quantum data!

Simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA)
---------------------------------------------------------

SPSA is a general method for minimizing differentiable multivariate functions.
It is particularly useful for functions for which evaluating the gradient is not
possible, or too resource intensive. SPSA provides a stochastic method for
approximating the gradient of the cost function. To
accomplish this, the cost function is evaluated twice using perturbed parameter
vectors: every component of the original parameter vector is simultaneously
shifted with a randomly generated value. This is in contrast to
finite-differences methods where for each evaluation only one component of the
parameter vector is shifted at a time.

Similar to gradient-based approaches such as gradient descent, SPSA is an
iterative optimization algorithm. Let's consider a differentiable cost function
:math:`L(\theta)` where :math:`\theta` is a :math:`p`-dimensional vector and
where the optimization problem can be translated into finding a optimal
parameter setting :math:`\theta^*`
at which :math:`\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0`.  It is assumed that
measurements of :math:`L(\theta)` are available at various values of
:math:`\theta`---this is exactly the problem that we'd consider when optimizing
quantum functions!

SPSA starts with an initial parameter vector :math:`\hat{\theta}_{0}`.
Its update rule is very similar to the one of standard gradient descent:

.. math:: \hat{\theta}_{k+1} = \hat{\theta}_{k} - a_{k}\hat{g}_{k}(\hat{\theta}_{k}),

where :math:`\hat{g}_{k}` is the stochastic estimate of the gradient
:math:`g(\theta) = \frac{ \partial L}{\partial \theta}`
at the iterate :math:`\hat{\theta}_{k}`
based on prior measurements of the cost function, and :math:`a_{k}` is a
positive number [#spall_overview]_.

One of the advantages of SPSA is that it is robust to noise that may occur
when measuring the function :math:`L`. Therefore, let's consider the function
:math:`y(\theta)=L(\theta) + \varepsilon`, where :math:`\varepsilon` is some
perturbation of the output. In SPSA, the estimated gradient at each iteration
step is expressed as

.. math:: \hat{g}_{ki} (\hat{\theta}_{k}) = \frac{y(\hat{\theta}_{k} +c_{k}\Delta_{k})
    - y(\hat{\theta}_{k} -c_{k}\Delta_{k})}{2c_{k}\Delta_{ki}},

where :math:`c_{k}` is a positive number and :math:`\Delta_{k} = (\Delta_{k_1},
\Delta_{k_2}, ..., \Delta_{k_p})^{T}` is a perturbation vector. The
stochasticity of the technique comes from the fact that for each iteration step
:math:`k` the components of the :math:`\Delta_{k}` perturbation vector are
randomly generated using a zero-mean distribution. In most cases, the Rademacher
distribution is used, meaning each parameter is simultaneously perturbed by
either :math:`\pm c_k`.

It is this perturbation that makes SPSA robust to noise --- since every
parameter is already being shifted, additional shifts due to noise are less
likely to hinder the optimization process. In a sense, noise gets "absorbed"
into the already-stochastic process. This is highlighted in the figure below,
which portrays an example of the type of path SPSA takes through the space of
the function, compared to a standard gradient-based optimizer.

Now that we have explored how SPSA works, let's see how it performs in practice!

Optimization on a sampling device
---------------------------------

First, let's consider a simple quantum circuit on a sampling device. For this,
we'll be using a device from the `PennyLane-Qiskit plugin
<https://pennylaneqiskit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ that samples quantum
circuits to get measurement outcomes and later post-processes these outcomes to
compute statistics like expectation values.

.. note::

    Just as with other PennyLane device, the number of samples taken for a circuit
    execution can be specified using the ``shots`` keyword argument of the
    device.

Once we have a device selected, we just need a couple of other ingredients for
the pieces of an example optimization to come together:

* a circuit ansatz: :func:`~pennylane.templates.layers.StronglyEntanglingLayers`,
* initial parameters: the correct shape can be computed by the ``shape`` method of the ansatz.
  We also use a seed so that we can simulate the same optimization every time
  (except for the device noise and shot noise).
* an observable: :math:`\bigotimes_{i=0}^{N-1}\sigma_z^i`, where :math:`N` stands
  for the number of qubits.
* the number of layers in the ansatz and the number of wires.
  We choose five layers and four wires.

# Once we have defined each piece of the optimization, there's only one
# remaining component required: the *SPSA optimizer*.
# We'll use the :class:`~pennylane.SPSAOptimizer` built into PennyLane,
# for 200 iterations in total.
#
# Choosing the hyperparameters
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# The ``SPSAOptimizer`` allows us to choose the initial value of two
# hyperparameters for SPSA: the :math:`c` and :math:`a` coefficients. Recall
# from above that the :math:`c` values control the scale of the random shifts when
# evaluating the cost function, while the :math:`a` coefficient is analogous to a
# learning rate and affects the rate at which the parameters change at each update
# step.
#
# With stochastic approximation, specifying such hyperparameters significantly
# influences the convergence of the optimization for a given problem. Although
# there is no universal recipe for selecting these values (as they depend
# strongly on the specific problem), [#spall_implementation]_ includes
# guidelines for the selection. In our case, the initial values for :math:`c`
# and :math:`a` were selected as a result of a grid search to ensure a fast
# convergence.  We further note that apart from :math:`c` and :math:`a`, there
# are further coefficients that are initialized in the ``SPSAOptimizer``
# using the previously mentioned guidelines. For more details, also consider the
# `PennyLane documentation of the optimizer
# <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.SPSAOptimizer.html>`__

#
# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# SPSA is a useful optimization technique that may be particularly beneficial on
# near-term quantum hardware. It uses significantly fewer circuit executions to achieve
# comparable results as gradient-based methods, giving it the potential
# to save time and resources. It can be a good alternative to
# gradient-based methods when the optimization problem involves executing
# quantum circuits with many free parameters.
#
# There are also extensions to SPSA that could be interesting to explore in
# this context. One, in particular, uses an adaptive technique to approximate
# the *Hessian* matrix during optimization to effectively increase the
# convergence rate of SPSA [#spall_hessian]_.
#
# In addition, there is a proposal to use an SPSA variant of the quantum natural
# gradient [#qnspsa]_.
# This is implemented in PennyLane as well and we discuss it in the
# :doc:`demo on QNSPSA </demos/qnspsa>`.

"""
Using qsim for supremacy
========================

In the paper `Quantum supremacy using a programmable superconducting processor
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5>`_ Google showed that their
quantum computer could complete a task that would take a classical computer
thousands of years. For their simulation benchmarks they used a simulator called
qsim.

In this demonstarion, we will walk you through how their benchmarks and provide
an example of what their simulations looked like. We will be using PennyLane
along with the PennyLane-Cirq plugin and the qsim-device, running via the Cirq
backend.

# To start we need to define the qubit grid that we will use for mimics Google's

# We define the 12 qubits in a rectangular grid, and label the corresponding
# wires in a way that makes it easier to reference the specific qubits later.

# already are implemented in Cirq, and thus are supported by qsim. To
# simplify the circuit definition, we define the remaining gates before
# the circuit is created.
#
# For the single qubit gates we need the :math:`\sqrt{X}` gate, which
# can be written as :math:`RX(\pi/2)`, the :math:`\sqrt{Y}` gate which
# can be written as :math:`RY(\pi/2)`, as well as the

#       0 & i & 0 & 0 \\
#       0 & 0 & 0 & 1

######################################################################
# Here comes a bit of a tricky part. The way the paper decides which
# qubits the two-qubit gates should be applied to depends on how they are
# connected to each other. In an alternating pattern, each pair of
# neighbouring qubits gets labeled with a letter A-D, where A and B
# correspond to all horizontally neighbouring qubits, and C and D to the
# vertically neighbouring qubits.
#
# The logic below iterates through all connections and returns a
# dictionary ``d`` with list of tuples containing two neighbouring qubits
# with the key as their connection label.
#

            d["D"].append((wire_1, wire_2))


######################################################################
# At this point we can define a gate sequence, which is the order in which
# qubit-pairs the two-qubit gates are applied to. E.g. ``["A", "B"]``
# would mean that the two-qubit gates are first applied to all qubits
# connected with label A, and then, during the next full cycle, the
# two-qubit gates are applied to all qubits connected with label B. This
# would then correspond to a 2-cycle run.
#
# While we can define any patterns we'd like, the two gate sequences below
# are the ones that are used in the supremacy paper. The shorter one is
# used for their classically verifiable benchmarking, while the slightly
# longer sequence is much harder to simulate classically and is used for
# estimating the cross-entroby fidelity in what they call the supremacy
# regime. We will use the shorter gate sequence for the following
# demonstration, although feel free to play around with other combinations
# if you wish.

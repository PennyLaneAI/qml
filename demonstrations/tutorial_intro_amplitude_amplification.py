r"""Intro to Amplitude Amplification
=======================================================================

`Grover's algorithm <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_grovers_algorithm/>`_ is one of the most important
developments in quantum computing. This technique is a special case of a quantum algorithm called
**Amplitude Amplification** (Amp Amp). In this demo, you will learn its basic principles and
how to implement it in PennyLane using the new :class:`~.AmplitudeAmplification` template. We also discuss
a useful extension of the algorithm called fixed-point amplitude amplification.

Amplitude Amplification
-------------------------

Our goal is to prepare an unknown state :math:`|\phi\rangle` knowing certain property of the state.
A first approach is to design a quantum circuit described by a unitary :math:`U` that generates an initial state :math:`|\Psi\rangle= U|0\rangle`
that has a non-zero overlap with the target state :math:`|\phi\rangle`.
Any state can be represented in the computational basis as:

.. math::
    |\Psi\rangle = \sum_i c_i |i\rangle \quad \text{where} \quad c_i \in \mathbb{C}.

But we can find better representations üòà. One choice is to make :math:`|\phi\rangle` an element of the basis. We can then write

.. math::
    |\Psi\rangle = \alpha |\phi\rangle + \beta |\phi^{\perp}\rangle,

where  :math:`|\phi^{\perp}\rangle` is some state orthogonal
to :math:`|\phi\rangle`, and :math:`\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}`. This allows us to represent 
the initial state in a two-dimensional space --- a crucial advantage that we will exploit repeatedly. Notice that this representation is even simpler than a Bloch
sphere since the amplitudes are real numbers, so we can visualize all operations inside a circle, as shown in the image below:

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/intro_amplitude_amplification/ampamp1.jpeg
    :align: center
    :width: 60%
    :target: javascript:void(0)


The two axes correspond to the states :math:`|\phi\rangle` and :math:`|\phi^{\perp}\rangle`. In the figure we also show the initial state :math:`|\Psi\rangle`, which
forms an angle of :math:`\theta=\arcsin(\alpha)`  with the x-axis.

Our aim is to **amplify** the amplitude :math:`\alpha` to get closer
to :math:`|\phi\rangle`, hence the name Amplitude Amplification [#ampamp]_ üòè. We will use this geometric picture to identify a sequence of operators that moves
the initial vector :math:`|\Psi\rangle` as close to :math:`|\phi\rangle` as possible.

The algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To obtain the state :math:`|\phi\rangle`, we could just rotate the initial state counterclockwise
by an angle :math:`\pi/2 -\theta`.  However, we don't explicitly know :math:`|\phi\rangle`,
so it's unclear how this could be done.  This is where a great idea is born: **what if instead of rotations we think of reflections?**

The main insight of the Amp Amp algorithm is that there is a sequence of **two reflections** that allow us to effectively perform a rotation towards the target state. The first is the reflection with respect to :math:`|\phi^{\perp}\rangle` and the second one is the reflection with respect to :math:`|\Psi\rangle`.

Let's go step by step. First we apply the reflection around :math:`|\phi^{\perp}\rangle`:

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/intro_amplitude_amplification/ampamp2.jpeg
    :align: center
    :width: 60%
    :target: javascript:void(0)


This reflection  may seem challenging to implement since we do not explicitly know :math:`|\phi^{\perp}\rangle`. However, the operator performing the reflection is well-defined:

.. math::
     \begin{cases}
     R_{\phi^{\perp}}|\phi\rangle = -|\phi\rangle, \\
     R_{\phi^{\perp}}|\phi^{\perp}\rangle = |\phi^{\perp}\rangle.
     \end{cases}

Amp Amp usually assumes access to an oracle implementing this reflection.
For example, in a search problem, this is the usual Grover oracle that "marks" the target state with a phase flip.
In practice, the way to build the oracle is just a classic check:
if the given state meets the known property, we change its sign. This will become clearer later with an example.


After applying the first reflection we are moving away from :math:`|\phi\rangle` --- why do that?
Well, sometimes it's necessary to take a step backward to take two steps
forward, and that is exactly what we will do. For this purpose, we use a second reflection with respect to :math:`|\Psi\rangle`. This is easier to build since
we know the operator :math:`U` that generates :math:`|\Psi\rangle`.

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/intro_amplitude_amplification/ampamp3.jpeg
    :align: center
    :width: 60%
    :target: javascript:void(0)

    Reflection with respect to :math:`|\Psi\rangle`.


Together, these two reflections are equivalent to rotating the state by :math:`2\theta` degrees from its original position,
where :math:`\theta` is the angle that defines the initial state. To amplify the amplitude and
approach the target state, we perform this sequence of rotations multiple times, i.e. :math:`\dots R_{\Psi}R_{\phi^{\perp}}R_{\Psi}R_{\phi^{\perp}}`. More precisely, we repeat them :math:`k` times, with :math:`k` given by:

.. math::
    k = \frac{\pi}{4 \theta}-\frac{1}{2}.

This expression is derived by recognizing that the angle of the resulting state after :math:`k` iterations is :math:`(2k + 1)\theta`,
and we aim for this value to be equal to :math:`\frac{\pi}{2}` radians (i.e. :math:`90¬∫`).

As we will see below, Amp Amp can be applied to unstructured dataset searching problems. Let's suppose that in a set
of N elements we are looking for a single one, and we begin with an equal superposition state such that :math:`\alpha=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}`.
The number of iterations required in this case is :math:`k \sim \frac{\pi \sqrt{N}}{4}`, making the complexity
of the algorithm :math:`\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})`. This provides a quadratic speedup compared to the
classical :math:`\mathcal{O}(N)` brute-force approach.

Amplitude Amplification in PennyLane
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's take a look at a practical example using PennyLane: solving the `zero-sum problem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_problem>`_.
In this task, we are given a list of :math:`n` integers and our goal is to find all subsets of numbers
whose sum is equal :math:`0`. In this example, we use the following set of integers:
"""


values = [1, -2, 3, 4, 5, -6]
n = len(values)

##############################################################################
# Can you find all the subsets that add to zero? ü§î 
#
# We will use Amplitude Amplification to solve the problem.
# First we define a binary variable :math:`x_i` that takes the value :math:`1` if we include the :math:`i`-th element in the
# subset and takes the value :math:`0` otherwise.
# We encode the :math:`i`-th variable in the :math:`i`-th qubit of a quantum state. For instance, :math:`|110001\rangle`
# represents the subset :math:`[1,-2,-6]` consisting of the first, second, and sixth element in the set.
# Later on, we will see how to solve it directly with :class:`~.AmplitudeAmplification`, but it is worthwhile to go
# step by step showing each part of the algorithm.
#
# We can now define the initial state:
#
# .. math::
#   |\Psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1}|i\rangle.
#
# This is a uniform superposition of all possible subsets so solutions are guaranteed to have non-zero amplitudes
# in :math:`|\Psi\rangle`. Let's generate the state and visualize it.

# Initially, the probability of getting any basis state is the same.
# The next step is to define the oracle that marks the elements that satisfy our property --- that the sum of the subset is zero.
# To do this we first create an operator that stores the sum of the selected subset in some auxiliary qubits.
# This operator, which we call :math:`\text{Sum}` , is defined as:
#
# .. math::
#     \text{Sum}|x\rangle|0\rangle = |x\rangle|\sum v_ix_i\rangle,
#
# where :math:`v_i` is the :math:`i`-th integer in the input set. For more details of how we build this operation take a
# look at `Basic arithmetic with the Quantum Fourier Transform <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qft_arithmetics/>`_.

# Great, we have flipped the sign of the solution states. Note that in this example we can check every possible subset explicitly, but this becomes exponentially hard for larger input sets. Still, this operator would correctly flip the sign of any solution.

# We can see that as the number of iterations increases, the probability of success increases as well. But we should be careful to not overdo it: after 5 iterations in our example, the amplitudes have in fact decreased. This phenomenon is known as "overcooking" and is a
# consequence of rotating the state too much. It can be addressed using fixed-point amplitude amplification, which we discuss below.

# Fixed-point Amplitude Amplification
# -------------------------------------
# In the above example, we have a problem: we do not know the number of solutions. Because of this we cannot
# calculate the exact number of iterations needed, so we do not know when to stop and might overcook the state. However, there is a variant
# of Amplitude Amplification that solves this issue: the fixed-point quantum search variant [#fixedpoint]_.
#
# The idea behind this technique is to avoid overcooking by gradually reducing the intensity of the resulting rotation with
# the help of an auxiliary qubit.
# The speed at which we decrease this intensity is carefully studied
# in reference [#fixedpoint]_ and has a very interesting interpretation related to the approximation of the
# sign function [#unification]_.
#
# To use this variant we simply set ``fixed_point = True`` and indicate the auxiliary qubit.
# Let's see what happens with the same example as before:

    U(wires=range(n))
    qml.AmplitudeAmplification(U = U(wires = range(n)),

                               fixed_point=True,
                               work_wire = n + 5)

    return qml.probs(wires = range(n))

# Unlike before, we can see that the probability of success does not decrease for a large number of iterations.
#
# Conclusion
# -----------
#
# In this demo we have shown the process of finding unknown states with Amplitude Amplification.
# We discussed some of its limitations and learned how to overcome them with the fixed-point version.
# This algorithm is important in a variety of workflows such as molecular simulation with QPE. This shouldn't be surprising, as it is generally helpful to rapidly amplify the amplitude of a target state. Moreover, the idea of using
# the reflections can be extrapolated to algorithms such as Qubitization or QSVT.
# PennyLane supports the Amplitude Amplification algorithm and its variants such as fixed-point and Oblivious Amplitude Amplification [#oblivious]_.
# We encourage you to explore them and see how they can help you in your quantum algorithms.

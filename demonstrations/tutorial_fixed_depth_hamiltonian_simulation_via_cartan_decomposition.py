r"""Fixed depth Hamiltonian simulation via Cartan decomposition
===============================================================

We introduce the powerful Lie-theoretic decomposition technique for Hamiltonians, :math:`H = K h_0 K^\dagger,`
that lets you perform time-evolution by arbitrary times with fixed depth, :math:`e^{-i t H} = K e^{-i t h_0} K^\dagger.`
In particular, we follow the approach in [#Kökcü]_ that directly provides us with a (fixed-depth) circuit
decomposition of the unitaries :math:`K` and :math:`e^{-i t h_0}.`

Sounds too good to be true? There are of course caveats as this fast-forwards the Hamiltonian.
In this algebraic setting, the crucial property is the size of the relevant :doc:`dynamical Lie algebra </demos/tutorial_liealgebra>` (DLA).
Most systems yield an exponentially large DLA, making them hard to manage in practice (i.e., fast-forwarding is not possible).
Yet, this is still an extremely powerful mathematical result integral for quantum compilation,
circuit optimization, and Hamiltonian simulation.

Introduction
------------

The :doc:`KAK theorem </demos/tutorial_kak_theorem>` is an important result from Lie theory that states that any Lie group element :math:`U` can be decomposed
as :math:`U = K_1 A K_2,` where :math:`K_{1, 2}` and :math:`A` are elements of two special sub-groups
:math:`\mathcal{K}` and :math:`\mathcal{A},` respectively. In special cases, the decomposition simplifies to :math:`U = K A K^\dagger.`

You can think of this KAK decomposition as a generalization of
the singular value decomposition to Lie groups. For that, recall that the singular value decomposition states that any
matrix :math:`M \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times n}` can be decomposed as :math:`M = U \Lambda V^\dagger,` where :math:`\Lambda`
are the diagonal singular values and :math:`U \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times \mu}` and :math:`V^\dagger \in \mathbb{C}^{\mu \times n}`
are left- and right-unitary with :math:`\mu = \min(m, n).`

In the case of the KAK decomposition, :math:`\mathcal{A}` is an Abelian subgroup in which all its elements are commuting,
just as is the case for diagonal matrices.

We can use this general result from Lie theory as a powerful circuit decomposition technique.

.. note:: We recommend a basic understanding of Lie algebras, see e.g. our :doc:`introduction to (dynamical) Lie algebras for quantum practitioners </demos/tutorial_liealgebra>`.
    Otherwise, this demo should be self-contained, though for the mathematically inclined, we further recommend our :doc:`demo on the KAK theorem </demos/tutorial_kak_theorem>`
    that dives into the mathematical depths of the theorem and provides more background info.

Goal: Fast-forwarding time evolutions using the KAK decomposition
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Unitary gates in quantum computing are described by the special unitary Lie group :math:`SU(2^n),` so we can use the KAK
theorem to decompose quantum gates into :math:`U = K_1 A K_2.` While the mathematical statement is rather straightforward,
actually finding this decomposition is not. We are going to follow the recipe prescribed in 
`Fixed Depth Hamiltonian Simulation via Cartan Decomposition <https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00728>`__ [#Kökcü]_, 
which tackles this decomposition on the level of the associated Lie algebra via Cartan decomposition.

In particular, we are going to consider the problem of time-evolving a Hermitian operator :math:`H` that generates the time-evolution unitary :math:`U = e^{-i t H}.`
We are going to perform a special case of KAK decomposition, a "KhK decomposition" if you will, on the algebraic level in terms of

.. math:: H = K h_0 K^\dagger.

This then induces the KAK decomposition on the group level as

.. math:: e^{-i t H} = K e^{-i t h_0} K^\dagger.

Let us walk through an explicit example, doing theory and code side-by-side.

For that, we are going to use the generators of the `Heisenberg model <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Heisenberg_model>`__ Hamiltonian for :math:`n=4` qubits on a one-dimensional chain,

.. math:: \{X_i X_{i+1}, Y_i Y_{i+1}, Z_i Z_{i+1}\}_{i=0}^{2}.

The foundation of a KAK decomposition is a Cartan decomposition of the associated Lie algebra :math:`\mathfrak{g}.`
Now, let us first import some libraries that we are going to use later and construct :math:`\mathfrak{g}.`

# Cartan decomposition
# --------------------
# 
# A Cartan decomposition is a bipartition :math:`\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{k} \oplus \mathfrak{m}` into a vertical subspace
# :math:`\mathfrak{k}` and an orthogonal horizontal subspace :math:`\mathfrak{m}.` In practice, it can be induced by an
# involution function :math:`\Theta` that fulfills :math:`\Theta(\Theta(g)) = g \ \forall g \in \mathfrak{g}.` Different 
# involutions lead to different types of Cartan decompositions, which have been fully classified by Cartan 
# (see `the classification of symmetric spaces by Cartan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_space#Classification_result>`__).
# 
# .. admonition:: Notation
#     :class: note
#
#     Note that :math:`\mathfrak{k}` is the small letter k in
#     `Fraktur <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraktur>`__ and a 
#     common — not our — choice for the vertical subspace in a Cartan decomposition.
#
# One common choice of involution is the so-called even-odd involution for Pauli words,
# :math:`P = P_1 \otimes P_2 .. \otimes P_n,` where :math:`P_j \in \{I, X, Y, Z\}.`
# It essentially counts whether the number of non-identity Pauli operators in the Pauli word is even or odd.

# So in order to perform the Cartan decomposition :math:`\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{k} \oplus \mathfrak{m},` we simply
# sort the operators by whether or not they yield a plus or minus sign from the involution function.

# .. admonition:: Choice of algebra representation
#     :class: note
#
#     In the case of Pauli words, we could make use of the well-known commutation relations of Pauli operators and treat the whole calculation semi-analytically
#     (as is done in [#Kökcü]_).
#     Here, we have chosen the full :math:`2^n` Hilbert space representation of the involved operators as this is actually faster for the chosen size :math:`n=4`.
#
#     More generally, we can use the adjoint identity introdcued in our :doc:`g-sim demo </demos/tutorial_liesim>` and perform all computations in the
#     adjoint representation of the algebra. In that case, the dimension of the algebra is the determining factor. This is useful when a low-dimensional Lie algebra
#     is embedded in a high dimensional Hilbert space. For example, the operators :math:`S^x_\text{total} = \sum_{j=1}^n X_j,`
#     :math:`S^y_\text{total} = \sum_{j=1}^n Y_j` and :math:`S^z_\text{total} = \sum_{j=1}^n Z_j` make up :math:`\mathfrak{su}(2)` of dimension :math:`3`, but are embedded

# We see the expected behavior of Suzuki—Trotter product formulas getting worse with an increase in time

#
# The KAK decomposition is particularly well-suited for smaller systems as the circuit depth is equal to the
# dimension of the subspaces, in particular :math:`2 |\mathfrak{k}| + |\mathfrak{h}|.` Note, however,
# that these dimensions typically scale exponentially in the system size.

##############################################################################
# 
# Conclusion
# ----------
# 
# The KAK theorem is a very general mathematical result with far-reaching consequences.
# While there is no canonical way of obtaining an actual decomposition in practice, we followed
# the approach of [#Kökcü]_ which uses a specifically designed loss function and variational
# optimization to find the decomposition.
# This approach has the advantage that the resulting decomposition is itself already decomposed in terms of rotation gates in the original Lie algebra,
# as opposed to other methods such as [#Chu]_ that find :math:`K` as a whole.
# We provided a flexible pipeline that lets users find KAK decompositions in PennyLane for systems with small 
# DLA (:doc:`Dynamical Lie Algebras <tutorial_liealgebra>`) and specifically decomposed the Heisenberg model Hamiltonian with :math:`n=4` qubits that has a DLA of dimension :math:`60` (:math:`\left(\mathfrak{s u}(2^{n-2})\right)^{\oplus 4}`).
#
# As most DLAs scale exponentially in the number of qubits, KAK decompositions are limited to small system sizes 
# or special cases of systems with small DLAs.
# This is in line with the notion that fast-forwarding is generally not possible and limited to special systems.
# In particular, a KAK decomposition is ultimately always a fast-forwarding of a Hamiltonian.

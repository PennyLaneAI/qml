##############################################################################
# In this tutorial we implement the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) for the MaxCut
# problem as proposed by `Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann (2014) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028>`__. First, we
# give an overview of the MaxCut problem using a simple example, a graph with 4 vertices and 4 edges. We then
# show how to find the maximum cut by running the QAOA algorithm using PennyLane.
#
# Background
# ----------
#
# The MaxCut problem
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# The aim of MaxCut is to maximize the number of edges (yellow lines) in a graph that are "cut" by
# a given partition of the vertices (blue circles) into two sets (see figure below).
#

#

#
# Consider a graph with :math:`m` edges and :math:`n` vertices. We seek the partition
# :math:`z` of the vertices into two sets
# :math:`A` and :math:`B` which maximizes
#
# .. math::
#   C(z) = \sum_{\alpha=1}^{m}C_\alpha(z),
#
# where :math:`C` counts the number of edges cut. :math:`C_\alpha(z)=1` if :math:`z` places one vertex from the
# :math:`\alpha^\text{th}` edge in set :math:`A` and the other in set :math:`B,` and :math:`C_\alpha(z)=0` otherwise.
# Finding a cut which yields the maximum possible value of :math:`C` is an NP-complete problem, so our best hope for a
# polynomial-time algorithm lies in an approximate optimization.
# In the case of MaxCut, this means finding a partition :math:`z` which
# yields a value for :math:`C(z)` that is close to the maximum possible value.
#
# We can represent the assignment of vertices to set :math:`A` or :math:`B` using a bitstring,
# :math:`z=z_1...z_n` where :math:`z_i=0` if the :math:`i^\text{th}` vertex is in :math:`A` and
# :math:`z_i = 1` if it is in :math:`B.` For instance,
# in the situation depicted in the figure above the bitstring representation is :math:`z=0101\text{,}`
# indicating that the :math:`0^{\text{th}}` and :math:`2^{\text{nd}}` vertices are in :math:`A`
# while the :math:`1^{\text{st}}` and :math:`3^{\text{rd}}` are in
# :math:`B.` This assignment yields a value for the objective function (the number of yellow lines cut)
# :math:`C=4,` which turns out to be the maximum cut. In the following sections,
# we will represent partitions using computational basis states and use PennyLane to
# rediscover this maximum cut.
#
# .. note:: In the graph above, :math:`z=1010` could equally well serve as the maximum cut.
#
# A circuit for QAOA
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# This section describes implementing a circuit for QAOA using basic unitary gates to find approximate
# solutions to the MaxCut problem.
# Firstly, denoting the partitions using computational basis states :math:`|z\rangle,` we can represent the terms in the
# objective function as operators acting on these states
#
# .. math::
#   C_\alpha = \frac{1}{2}\left(1-\sigma_{z}^j\sigma_{z}^k\right),
#
# where the :math:`\alpha\text{th}` edge is between vertices :math:`(j,k).`
# :math:`C_\alpha` has eigenvalue 1 if and only if the :math:`j\text{th}` and :math:`k\text{th}`
# qubits have different z-axis measurement values, representing separate partitions.
# The objective function :math:`C` can be considered a diagonal operator with integer eigenvalues.
#
# QAOA starts with a uniform superposition over the :math:`n` bitstring basis states,
#
# .. math::
#   |+_{n}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}\sum_{z\in \{0,1\}^n} |z\rangle.
#
#
# We aim to explore the space of bitstring states for a superposition which is likely to yield a
# large value for the :math:`C` operator upon performing a measurement in the computational basis.
# Using the :math:`2p` angle parameters
# :math:`\boldsymbol{\gamma} = \gamma_1\gamma_2...\gamma_p,` :math:`\boldsymbol{\beta} = \beta_1\beta_2...\beta_p`
# we perform a sequence of operations on our initial state:
#
# .. math::
#   |\boldsymbol{\gamma},\boldsymbol{\beta}\rangle = U_{B_p}U_{C_p}U_{B_{p-1}}U_{C_{p-1}}...U_{B_1}U_{C_1}|+_n\rangle
#
# where the operators have the explicit forms
#
# .. math::
#   U_{B_l} &= e^{-i\beta_lB} = \prod_{j=1}^n e^{-i\beta_l\sigma_x^j}, \\
#   U_{C_l} &= e^{-i\gamma_lC} = \prod_{\text{edge (j,k)}} e^{-i\gamma_l(1-\sigma_z^j\sigma_z^k)/2}.
#
# In other words, we make :math:`p` layers of parametrized :math:`U_bU_C` gates.
# These can be implemented on a quantum circuit using the gates depicted below, up to an irrelevant constant
# that gets absorbed into the parameters.
#

#    :align: center
#    :scale: 100%
#    :alt: qaoa_operators
#
# |
#
# .. note::
#     An alternative implementation of :math:`U_{C_l}` would be :math:`ZZ(\gamma_l)`, available
#     via :class:`~.pennylane.IsingZZ` in PennyLane.
#
# Let :math:`\langle \boldsymbol{\gamma},
# \boldsymbol{\beta} | C | \boldsymbol{\gamma},\boldsymbol{\beta} \rangle` be the expectation of the objective operator.
# In the next section, we will use PennyLane to perform classical optimization
# over the circuit parameters :math:`(\boldsymbol{\gamma}, \boldsymbol{\beta}).`
# This will specify a state :math:`|\boldsymbol{\gamma},\boldsymbol{\beta}\rangle` which is
# likely to yield an approximately optimal partition :math:`|z\rangle` upon performing a measurement in the
# computational basis.
# In the case of the graph shown above, we want to measure either 0101 or 1010 from our state since these correspond to
# the optimal partitions.

#
# Qualitatively, QAOA tries to evolve the initial state into the plane of the
# :math:`|0101\rangle,` :math:`|1010\rangle` basis states (see figure above).

# the graph. We also define the graph using
# the list ``graph``, which contains the tuples of vertices defining
# each edge in the graph.

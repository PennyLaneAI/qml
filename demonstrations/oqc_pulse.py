Pulse-level access to quantum computers offers many interesting new avenues in
quantum optimal control, variational quantum algorithms and device-aware algorithm design.
We now have the possibility to run hardware-level circuits combined with standard gates on a
physical device in ``PennyLane`` via ``AWS Braket`` on OQC's Lucy quantum computer. In this demo, 
we explain the underlying physical principles of driving transmon qubits and show how to perform custom pulse gates on hardware through PennyLane.

Introduction
------------

Additionally to accessing `neutral atom quantum computers by Quera through PennyLane and AWS <ahs_aquila>`_, we now 
have the possibility to access `Lucy` by Oxford Quantum Computing (OQC), an 8-qubit superconducting quantum computer with a ring-like connectivity.
Through the `PennyLane-Braket plugin <https://amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_,
we are able to design custom pulse gates that control the physical qubits at the lowest hardware level.
A neat feature is the ability to combine `digital` gates like :math:`\text{CNOT}, H, R_x, R_y, R_z` with `pulse` gates.
This ability allows us to differentiate parametrized pulse gates natively on hardware via our recently introduced 
`ODEgen` method [#Kottmann]_ (see :doc:`our demo on the method </demos/tutorial_odegen>`)

In this demo, we are going to explore the physical principles for hardware level control of transmon qubits and run custom pulse gates on 
OQC Lucy via the `pennylane-braket plugin <https://amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.
For a general introduction to pulse programming, see our `recent demo on it <tutorial_pulse_programming101>`_.

.. note::

    To access remote services on Amazon Braket, you first need to
    `create an account on AWS <https://aws.amazon.com/braket/getting-started/>`__ and follow the
    `setup instructions <https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-sdk-python>`__ for accessing Braket from Python.
    You also need to install the `pennylane-braket plugin <https://amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.


Transmon Physics
----------------

In this section, we are going to give an intuitive intro to the physical principles behind the control of superconducting transmon qubits.

Oxford Quantum Circuit's Lucy is a quantum computer with 8 superconducting transmon qubits based on the Coaxmon design [#Rahamim]_.
In order to control a transmon qubit, it is driven by a microwave pulse. The interaction between the transmon and the pulse can be
modeled by the Hamiltonian

.. math:: H(t) = - \frac{\omega_q}{2} Z_q + \Omega_q(t) \sin(\nu_q t + \phi_q) Y_q

where operators :math:`\{X_q, Y_q, Z_q\}` refer to the single-qubit Pauli operators acting on qubit :math:`q`, :math:`\omega_q` is the qubit frequency, :math:`\Omega_q(t)` is the drive amplitude,  :math:`\nu_q` denotes the drive frequency, and :math:`\phi_q` is the phase of the pulse.
All of these parameters are given or set for each qubit :math:`q =0, 1, .., 7` on the device.
Since we are going to focus on driving one single qubit, we are going to drop the subscript :math:`q` from here on.
We refer to section IV D in reference [#Krantz]_ for a good derivation and review from first principles.

We now want to understand the action of driving a qubit with this Hamiltonian.
The first term leads to a constant precession around the Z-axis on the Bloch sphere, whereas the second term introduces
the so-called Rabi oscillation between :math:`|0\rangle` and :math:`|1\rangle`.
This can be seen by the following simple simulation:
We evolve the state in the Bloch sphere from :math:`|0\rangle` with a constant pulse of :math:`\Omega(t) = 2 \pi \text{ GHz}`
for :math:`1 \text{ ns}`. We choose :math:`\omega = 5 \times 2\pi \text{ GHz}` as the drive and qubit frequency (i.e. we are at resonance :math:`\omega - \nu = 0`).

#     Results on the Bloch sphere after driving with different amplitudes and phases. Setting the phase :math:`\phi` leads to different rotation axes.
#
#
#
# So far, we have looked at transmon physics in the so-called lab frame. Another common way of understanding transmon physics
# is via the Hamiltonian expressed in the `qubit frame,` which rotates at the qubit frequency.
# We can change frames via the unitary transformation
# :math:`R = e^{-i \frac{\omega}{2}Z}` that leads to the transformed Hamiltonian :math:`\tilde{H}(t) = i R R^\dagger + R H R^\dagger`.
# In the rotating wave approximation (RWA) and on resonance (:math:`\omega = \nu`), this yields
# 
# .. math:: \tilde{H}(t) = - \frac{1}{2} \Omega(t) (\cos(\phi) X + \sin(\phi) Y).
# 
# This is another way of seeing how setting the phase :math:`\phi` controls the rotation axis of the qubit.
# In particular, we see how :math:`\phi = 0` (:math:`\pi/2`) leads to a :math:`X` (:math:`Y`) rotation.
# For a detailed derivation of the qubit frame Hamiltonian above, see reference [#Krantz]_, section IV, D1 (eq. (79) onwards).

# Rabi Oscillation Calibration
# ----------------------------

# For better comparability with classical simulations, we calibrate the attenuation :math:`\xi` between the device voltage output :math:`V_0`
# and the actual voltage :math:`V_\text{device} = \xi V_0` that the the superconducting qubit receives.
# The attenuation :math:`\xi` accounts for all losses between the arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) that outputs the signal in
# the lab at room temperature and all wires that lead to the cooled down chip in a cryostat.
# 
# We start by setting up the real device and a simulation device and perform all measurements on qubit 5.

Quantum Teleportation
=====================

This tutorial walks you through a popular quantum information technique known as
*quantum teleportation*. While teleportation has been thought of as the stuff of
sci-fi legend, we are going to prove that it is actually already possible today! The
technique leverages many foundational principles of quantum computing, and it has
lots of useful applications across the entire field. These principles include (but
are not limited to): the no-cloning theorem, quantum entanglement, and the
principle of deferred measurement. Let's dive in!

Goal: Transferring Quantum Information
--------------------------------------

Suppose there are two researchers named Alice and Bob, and Alice wants to send
her quantum state to Bob. The quantum teleportation protocol enables Alice to
do exactly this in a very elegant manner, and it can be described in four steps:

1. State preparation: Alice initializes her qubit to the state she wishes to
teleport.

2. Shared entanglement: A Bell state is created and distributed to Alice and
Bob (one qubit each).

3. Change of basis: Alice converts her two qubits from the Bell basis to the
computational basis.

4. Measurement: Alice measures her two qubits, then tells Bob how to convert
his qubit to obtain the desired state. Note that it is only quantum *information*
being teleported, and not a physical particle.

An overview of the protocol can be seen here:

Problem: The No-Cloning Theorem
-------------------------------

You might be wondering why we need to teleport a state at all. Can't Alice
just make a copy of it and send the copy to Bob? It turns out that copying
arbitrary states is *prohibited*, which you can understand using something called the
**no-cloning theorem**. The proof is surprisingly straightforward. Suppose we
would like to design a circuit (unitary transformation) :math:`U` that can
perform the following action:

.. math::

    \begin{align*}
    U(\vert \psi\rangle \otimes \vert s\rangle ) &= \vert \psi\rangle \otimes \vert \psi\rangle, \\
    U(\vert \varphi\rangle \otimes \vert s\rangle ) &= \vert \varphi \rangle \otimes \vert \varphi \rangle,
    \end{align*}

where :math:`\vert \psi\rangle` and :math:`\vert \varphi\rangle` are arbitrary,
normalized single-qubit states, and :math:`\vert s \rangle` is some arbitrary,
normalized starting state. We will now prove that no such :math:`U` exists!

First, let's take the inner product of the left-hand sides of the two equations:

.. math::

    (\langle \psi \vert \otimes \langle s \vert) U^\dagger U(\vert \varphi\rangle \otimes \vert s\rangle ) = \langle \psi \vert \varphi\rangle \  \langle s \vert s\rangle

Since :math:`\langle s \vert s\rangle` equals 1, this evaluates to
:math:`\langle \psi \vert \varphi \rangle`. Next, we compare the inner product of the
right-hand sides of the two equations: :math:`(\langle \psi \vert \varphi \rangle)^2`.
These inner products must be equal, and they are only equal if they are a value that
squares to itself. The only valid values for the inner product then are 1 and 0. But
if the inner product is 1, the states are the same; on the other hand, if the inner
product is 0, the states are orthogonal. Therefore, we can't clone arbitrary states!

Solution: Quantum Teleportation
----------------------------------

We will now walk through how to share quantum information without cloning it, one
step at a time.

# 1. State preparation

#
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/teleportation/teleport_circuit_state_preparation.svg
#     :align: center
#     :width: 75%
#
# Teleportation involves three qubits. Two of them are held by Alice, and the
# third by Bob. We'll denote their states using subscripts:
#
# 1. :math:`\vert\cdot\rangle_S`, Alice's first qubit that she will prepare in
#    some arbitrary state
# 2. :math:`\vert\cdot\rangle_A`, Alice's auxiliary (or "ancilla") qubit that
#    she will entangle with Bob's qubit for communication purposes
# 3. :math:`\vert \cdot\rangle_B`, Bob's qubit that will receive the teleported
#    state
#
# Together, their starting state is:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \vert 0\rangle_S \vert 0\rangle_A \vert 0\rangle_B.
#
# The first thing Alice does is prepare her first qubit in whichever state :math:`\vert
# \psi\rangle` that she'd like to send to Bob so that their combined state
# becomes:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \vert \psi\rangle_S \vert 0\rangle_A \vert 0\rangle_B.
#
# We can use the following `quantum function <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/introduction/circuits.html#quantum-functions>`__
# to do the state preparation step:

import pennylane as qml
import numpy as np


def state_preparation(state):
    qml.StatePrep(state, wires=["S"])

#
# 2. Shared entanglement
# ``````````````````````
#
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/teleportation/teleport_circuit_entanglement.svg
#     :align: center
#     :width: 75%
#
# The reason why teleportation works is the use of an *entangled state* as a
# shared resource between Alice and Bob. You can imagine some process that
# generates a pair of entangled qubits, and sends one qubit to each party. For
# simplicity (and simulation!), we will represent the entanglement process as
# part of our circuit.
#
# Entangling the qubits :math:`A` and :math:`B` leads to the combined state:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left( \vert \psi\rangle_S \vert 0\rangle_A \vert 0\rangle_B + \vert \psi\rangle_S \vert 1\rangle_A \vert 1\rangle_B \right)\tag{1}
#
# The :math:`AB` subsystem is now in what is known as a *Bell state*. There are
# four maximally entangled two-qubit Bell states, and they form the Bell basis:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \begin{align*}
#     \vert \psi_+\rangle &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \vert 00\rangle + \vert 11\rangle \right), \\
#     \vert \psi_-\rangle &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \vert 00\rangle - \vert 11\rangle \right), \\
#     \vert \phi_+\rangle &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \vert 01\rangle + \vert 10\rangle \right), \\
#     \vert \phi_-\rangle &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \vert 01\rangle - \vert 10\rangle \right).
#     \end{align*}
#
# In our experiment, because :math:`AB` started in the :math:`\vert 00\rangle`
# state, we create the :math:`\vert \psi_+\rangle` Bell state as is shown in
# equation (1).


def entangle_qubits():
    qml.Hadamard(wires="A")
    qml.CNOT(wires=["A", "B"])

# From now on, the qubit subscripts will be removed from states for brevity.
#
# 3. Change of basis
# ``````````````````
#
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/teleportation/teleport_circuit_change_of_basis.svg
#     :align: center
#     :width: 75%
#
# This is where things get tricky, but also very interesting. The third step of
# the protocol is to apply a CNOT and a Hadamard to the first two qubits. This is
# done prior to the measurements, and labelled "change of basis". But what basis
# is this? Notice how these two gates are the *opposite* of what we do to create a
# Bell state. If we run them in the opposite direction, we transform the basis
# back to the computational one, and simulate a measurement in the Bell basis.
#
# After the basis transform, if we observe the first two qubits to be in the state
# :math:`\vert 00\rangle`, this would correspond to the outcome :math:`\vert \psi_+\rangle` in
# the Bell basis, :math:`\vert 11\rangle` would correspond to :math:`\vert \phi_-\rangle`,
# etc. Let's perform this change of basis, one step at a time.
#
# Suppose we write our initial state :math:`\vert \psi\rangle` as
# :math:`\alpha\vert 0\rangle + \beta\vert 1\rangle`, with :math:`\alpha` and
# :math:`\beta` being complex coefficients. Expanding out the terms from (1), we obtain:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} ( \alpha\vert 000\rangle +
#     \beta\vert 100\rangle + \alpha \vert 011\rangle +
#     \beta\vert 111\rangle )
#
# Now let's apply a CNOT between Alice's two qubits:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} ( \alpha\vert 000\rangle +
#     \beta\vert 110\rangle + \alpha \vert 011\rangle +
#     \beta\vert 101\rangle )
#
# And then a Hadamard on her first qubit:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \frac{1}{2} ( \alpha \vert 000\rangle + \alpha\vert 100\rangle + \beta\vert 010\rangle - \beta\vert 110\rangle + \alpha \vert 011\rangle + \alpha \vert 111 \rangle + \beta\vert 001\rangle - \beta\vert 101 \rangle ).
#
# Now we need to do some rearranging. We group the terms based on the first two qubits:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \frac{1}{2} \vert 00\rangle(\alpha\vert 0\rangle + \beta\vert 1\rangle) + \frac{1}{2}\vert 01\rangle (\beta\vert 0\rangle + \alpha\vert 1\rangle) + \frac{1}{2}\vert 10\rangle (\alpha\vert 0\rangle - \beta\vert 1\rangle) + \frac{1}{2}\vert 11\rangle (-\beta\vert 0\rangle + \alpha\vert 1\rangle).\tag{2}


def basis_rotation():
    qml.CNOT(wires=["S", "A"])
    qml.Hadamard(wires="S")

#
# 4. Measurement
# ``````````````
#
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/teleportation/teleport_circuit_measurement.svg
#     :align: center
#     :width: 75%
#
# The last step of the protocol involves Alice performing a measurement on her
# qubits, and telling Bob to perform some operations depending on what she
# measured. But why exactly do we need to do this? In the previous step, we
# already performed a basis rotation back to the computational basis, so
# shouldn't we be good to go? Not quite, but almost!
#
# Let's take another look at equation (2). If Alice measures her two qubits in the
# computational basis, she is equally likely to obtain any of the four possible
# outcomes. If she observes the first two qubits in the state :math:`\vert 00 \rangle`,
# she would immediately know that Bob's qubit was in the state
# :math:`\alpha \vert 0 \rangle + \beta \vert 1 \rangle`, which is precisely the
# state we are trying to teleport!
#
# If instead she observed the qubits in state :math:`\vert 01\rangle`, she'd still
# know what state Bob has, but it's a little off from the original state. In particular,
# we have:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \beta \vert 0 \rangle + \alpha \vert 1 \rangle = X \vert \psi \rangle.
#
# After obtaining these results, Alice could tell Bob to simply apply an X
# gate to his qubit to recover the original state. Similarly, if she obtained
# :math:`\vert 10\rangle`, she would tell him to apply a Z gate.
#
# In the `"traditional" version of quantum
# teleportation <https://quantum.country/teleportation>`__ [#Teleportation1993]_,
# this is, in fact, exactly what happens. Alice would call up Bob on the phone,
# tell him which state she observed, and then he would be able to apply an appropriate
# correction. In this situation, measurements are happening partway through the protocol,
# and the results would be used to control the application of future quantum gates. This
# is known as mid-circuit measurement, and such mid-circuit measurements are expressed
# in PennyLane using :func:`qml.measure <pennylane.measure>`. Mid-circuit measurement
# results can be used to control operations, and this is expressed in PennyLane using
# :func:`qml.cond <pennylane.cond>`.


def measure_and_update():
    m0 = qml.measure("S")
    m1 = qml.measure("A")
    qml.cond(m1, qml.PauliX)("B")

#
# There is a neat concept known as the `principle of deferred measurement
# <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_Measurement_Principle>`__ [#NandC2000]_,
# and it basically states that we can push all our measurements to the *end*
# of our circuit. This can be useful for a variety of reasons, such as when
# working in a system that does not support mid-circuit measurements. In
# PennyLane, when you bind a circuit to a device that does not support them,
# it will automatically apply the principle of deferred measurement and update
# your circuit to use controlled operations instead. Note that you need to
# specify ``expansion_strategy="device"`` when calling ``draw_mpl`` so it
# runs the device pre-processing before drawing the circuit.

#
# Poof! Our classical signals have been turned into CNOT and CZ gates. This is
# exactly what the principle of deferred measurement gives us — we can apply a
# CNOT instead of Alice calling Bob and telling him to apply an X gate, and
# likewise for the CZ gate. This is incredibly useful, as it allows us to
# perform our correction *before* any measurements are made. Let's evaluate the
# action of the CNOT and CZ on Bob's qubit, and ensure that Alice's state has been
# successfully teleported. Applying the CNOT yields:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \frac{1}{2} \vert 00\rangle(\alpha\vert 0\rangle + \beta\vert 1\rangle) + \frac{1}{2}\vert 01\rangle (\alpha\vert 0\rangle + \beta\vert 1\rangle) + \frac{1}{2}\vert 10\rangle (\alpha\vert 0\rangle - \beta\vert 1\rangle) + \frac{1}{2}\vert 11\rangle (\alpha\vert 0\rangle - \beta\vert 1\rangle)
#
# Then, applying the CZ yields:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \frac{1}{2} \vert 00\rangle(\alpha\vert 0\rangle + \beta\vert 1\rangle) + \frac{1}{2}\vert 01\rangle (\alpha\vert 0\rangle + \beta\vert 1\rangle) + \frac{1}{2}\vert 10\rangle (\alpha\vert 0\rangle + \beta\vert 1\rangle) + \frac{1}{2}\vert 11\rangle (\alpha\vert 0\rangle + \beta\vert 1\rangle)\tag{3}
#
# When Alice measures her two qubits at the end, no matter which outcome she
# gets, Bob's qubit will be in the state :math:`\alpha\vert 0\rangle + \beta \vert
# 1\rangle`. This means that our protocol has changed the state of Bob's qubit
# into the one Alice wished to send him, which is truly incredible!
#
# We can use :func:`qml.density_matrix <pennylane.density_matrix>` to trace out
# and return Bob's subsystem as a density matrix, which is a more general
# description of the state of his qubit. We will use this to verify that Alice's
# state was successfully teleported to Bob's qubit.
# Re-arranging equation (3), we can see that the final state of the system is:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \frac{1}{2} (\vert 00\rangle + \vert 01\rangle + \vert 10\rangle + \vert 11\rangle) \vert \psi\rangle\tag{4}
#
# Now, we can confirm that our implementation of the quantum teleportation protocol
# is working as expected by comparing Bob's final density matrix to Alice's original
# density matrix:


def teleport_state(state):
    teleported_density_matrix = teleport(state)
    original_density_matrix = qml.math.dm_from_state_vector(state)

    if not np.allclose(teleported_density_matrix, original_density_matrix):
        raise ValueError(
            f"Alice's state ({state}) not teleported properly. "
            f"Final density matrix of Bob's subsystem: {teleported_density_matrix}"
        )
    print("State successfully teleported!")

# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# Let's recap the concepts we've learned throughout this tutorial. First, we
# established that quantum states cannot be arbitrarily copied due to the
# *no-cloning theorem*. Then, we learned about *quantum entanglement*. Once
# Alice and Bob shared an entangled pair of qubits, Alice performed a *change
# of basis* from the Bell basis to the computational basis. Finally, using the
# *principle of deferred measurement* when needed, Alice measured her two
# qubits and informed Bob on how to rotate his qubit into the desired state.
#

#     :width: 75%
#
# Just like that, Alice and Bob performed quantum teleportation, and with a
# fairly small circuit! Some of you may now be thinking that teleportation is
# impossible, and you would be in good company if so. Einstein himself referred
# to the non-local nature of entanglement as "spooky action at a distance", but
# we can all rest easy: due to the need for classical communication from Alice
# to Bob, quantum states (in other words, information) still cannot be
# teleported faster than the speed of light. Don't let that take away from
# the importance of quantum teleportation! This protocol is a critical tool in
# quantum information processing, and now it is a tool that you wield.

r"""Quantum Defect Embedding Theory (QDET)
=========================================
Many interesting problems in quantum chemistry and materials science feature a strongly correlated
region embedded within a larger environment. Example of such systems include point defects in
materials [#Galli]_, active site of catalysts [#SJRLee]_ and surface phenomenon such as adsorption
[#Gagliardi]_. Such systems can be accurately simulated with **embedding theories**, which effectively
capture the strong electronic correlations in the active region with high accuracy, while accounting
for the environment in a more approximate manner.

In this demo, we show how to implement quantum defect embedding theory (QDET) [#Galli]_. This method
has been successfully applied to study systems such as defects in calcium oxide [#Galli]_ and to calculate
excitations of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy defect in diamond [#Galli2]_. QDET can be used to calculate ground states,
excited states, and dynamic properties of materials. These make QDET a powerful method for affordable quantum simulation
of materials. Another important advantage
of QDET is the compatibility of the method with quantum algorithms as we explain in the following
sections.

#############################################
# The main component of a QDET simulation is to construct an effective Hamiltonian that describes
# the impurity subsystem and its interaction with the environment. In second quantization, the
# effective Hamiltonian can be represented in terms of electronic creation, :math:`a^{\dagger}`, and
# annihilation , :math:`a`, operators as
#
# .. math::
#
#     H^{eff} = \sum_{ij} t_{ij}^{eff}a_i^{\dagger}a_j + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{ijkl} v_{ijkl}^{eff}a_i^{\dagger}a_{j}^{\dagger}a_ka_l,
#
# where :math:`t_{ij}^{eff}` and :math:`v_{ijkl}^{eff}` represent the effective one-body and
# two-body integrals, respectively, and the indices :math:`ijkl` span over the orbitals inside the impurity.
# This Hamiltonian describes a simplified representation of the quantum system that is more
# computationally tractable, while properly capturing the essential physics of the problem.
#
# Implementation
# --------------
# A QDET simulation typically starts by obtaining a meanfield approximation of the whole system
# using efficient quantum chemistry methods such as density functional theory (DFT). These
# calculations provide a set of orbitals that are partitioned into **impurity** and **bath** orbitals.
# The effective Hamiltonian is constructed from the impurity orbitals and is subsequently solved
# by using either a high accuracy classical method or a quantum algorithm. Let's implement these
# steps for an example!
#
# Mean field calculations
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# We implement QDET to compute the excitation energies of a negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy
# defect in diamond [#Galli2]_. We use DFT to obtain a mean field description of the whole system.
# The DFT calculations are performed with the `QUANTUM ESPRESSO <https://www.quantum-espresso.org/>`_
# package. This requires downloading pseudopotentials [#Modji]_ for each atomic species
# in the system from the QUANTUM ESPRESSO `database <https://www.quantum-espresso.org/pseudopotentials/>`_.
# To prepare our system, the necessary carbon and nitrogen pseudopotentials can be downloaded by executing
# the following commands through the terminal or command prompt:
#
# .. code-block:: bash
#
#    wget -N -q http://www.quantum-simulation.org/potentials/sg15_oncv/upf/C_ONCV_PBE-1.2.upf
#    wget -N -q http://www.quantum-simulation.org/potentials/sg15_oncv/upf/N_ONCV_PBE-1.2.upf
#
# Next, we need to create the input file for running QUANTUM ESPRESSO. This contains
# information about the system and the DFT calculations. More details on how to construct the input
# file can be found in QUANTUM ESPRESSO `documentation <https://www.quantum-espresso.org/Doc/INPUT_PW.html>`_
# page. For the system taken here, the input file can be downloaded with
#
# .. code-block:: bash
#
#    wget -N -q https://west-code.org/doc/training/nv_diamond_63/pw.in
#
# DFT calculations can now be initiated using the `pw.x` executable in `WEST`, taking `pw.in` as the input file
# and directing the output to `pw.out`. This process is parallelized across 2 cores using mpirun.
#
# .. code-block:: bash
#
#    mpirun -n 2 pw.x -i pw.in > pw.out
#
# Identify the impurity
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# Once we have obtained the mean field description, we can identify our impurity by finding
# the states that are localized around the defect region in real space. To do that, we compute the
# localization factor :math:`L_n` for each state ``n``, defined as:
#
# .. math::
#
#     L_n = \int_{V \in \Omega} d^3 r |\Psi_n(r)|^2,
#
# where :math:`V` is the identified volume including the impurity within the supercell volume
# :math:`\Omega` and :math:`\Psi` is the wavefunction [#Galli2]_. We will use the
# `WEST <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ct500958p>`_ program to compute the localization factor.
# This requires the westpp.in input file, example for which is shown below. Here, we specify the
# box parameters within which the localization factor is being computed; the vectors for this box are provided in
# in atomic units as [x_start, x_end, y_start, y_end, z_start, z_end].
#
# .. code-block:: text
#
#    westpp_control:
#      westpp_calculation: L # triggers the calculation of the localization factor
#      westpp_range:         # defines the range of states to compute the localization factor
#      - 1                   # start from the first state
#      - 176                 # use all 176 states
#      westpp_box:           # specifies the parameter of the box in atomic units for integration
#      - 6.19
#      - 10.19
#      - 6.28
#      - 10.28
#      - 6.28
#      - 10.28
#
# The calculation can now be performed by running the westpp.x executable from WEST using mpirun to
# parallelize it across two cores.
#
# .. code-block:: bash
#
#    mpirun -n 2 westpp.x -i westpp.in > westpp.out
#
# This creates the file ``westpp.json`` which contains the information we need here. Since
# computational resources required to run the calculation are large, for the purpose of this tutorial we just
# download a pre-computed file with:
#
# .. code-block:: bash
#
#    mkdir -p west.westpp.save
#    wget -N -q https://west-code.org/doc/training/nv_diamond_63/box_westpp.json -O west.westpp.save/westpp.json
#
# We can plot the computed localization factor for each of the states:
#
# .. code-block:: bash
#
#    import json
#    import numpy as np
#    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#
#    with open('west.westpp.save/westpp.json','r') as f:
#        data = json.load(f)
#
#    y = np.array(data['output']['L']['K000001']['local_factor'],dtype='f8')
#    x = np.array([i+1 for i in range(y.shape[0])])
#
#    plt.plot(x,y,'o')
#    plt.axhline(y=0.08,linestyle='--',color='red')
#
#    plt.xlabel('Kohn-Sham orbital index')
#    plt.ylabel('Localization factor')
#
#    plt.show()

#
# From this plot, it is easy to see that the orbitals can be categorized as orbitals with low and
# high localization factors. For the purpose of defining an impurity, we need highly localized
# orbitals, so we set a cutoff of :math:`0.06` , illustrated by the red dashed line, and choose the orbitals that have a localization
# factor larger than :math:`0.06`. We'll use these orbitals for the calculation of the parameters
# needed to construct the effective Hamiltonian.
#
# Electronic Integrals
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# The next step in QDET is to define the effective one-body and two-body integrals for the impurity.
# The effective two-body integrals :math:`v^{eff}` are computed first as matrix elements of the
# partially screened static Coulomb potential :math:`W_0^{R}`.
#
# .. math::
#
#     v_{ijkl}^{eff} = [W_0^{R}]_{ijkl},
#
# where :math:`W_0^R` results from screening the bare Coulomb potential :math:`v` with the reduced
# polarizability :math:`P_0^R = P - P_{imp}`, where :math:`P` is the system's polarizability and
# :math:`P_{imp}` is the impurity's polarizability. Since solving the effective Hamiltonian
# accounts for the exchange and correlation interactions between the active electrons, we remove
# these interactions from the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian :math:`H^{KS}` to avoid double counting them.
#
# The one-body term :math:`t^{eff}` is obtained by subtracting from the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian the
# double-counting term accounting for electrostatic and exchange-correlation interactions in the
# active space.
#
# .. math::
#
#     t_{ij}^{eff} = H_{ij}^{KS} - t_{ij}^{dc}.
#
# We use the WEST program to compute these parameters. WEST will first compute the
# quasiparticle energies, then the partially screened Coulomb potential, and finally
# the parameters of the effective Hamiltonian. The input file for such a calculations is
# shown below:
#
# .. code-block:: text
#
#    wstat_control:
#      wstat_calculation: S           # starts the calculation from scratch
#      n_pdep_eigen: 512              # number of eigenpotentials; matches number of electrons
#      trev_pdep: 0.00001             # convergence threshold for eigenvalues
#
#    wfreq_control:
#      wfreq_calculation: XWGQH       # compute quasiparticle corrections and Hamiltonian params
#      macropol_calculation: C        # include long-wavelength limit for condensed systems
#      l_enable_off_diagonal: true    # calculate off-diagonal elements of G_0-W_0 self-energy
#      n_pdep_eigen_to_use: 512       # number of PDEP eigenvectors to be used
#      qp_bands: [87,122,123,126,127,128] # impurity orbitals
#      n_refreq: 300                  # number of frequencies on the real axis
#      ecut_refreq: 2.0               # cutoff for the real frequencies
#
# We can now execute the calculation with:
#
# .. code-block:: bash
#
#    mpirun -n 2 wfreq.x -i wfreq.in > wfreq.out
#
# This calculation takes some time and requires computational resources, therefore we download a
# pre-computed output file with
#
# .. code-block:: bash
#
#    mkdir -p west.wfreq.save
#    wget -N -q https://west-code.org/doc/training/nv_diamond_63/wfreq.json -O west.wfreq.save/wfreq.json
#
# This output file contains all the information we need to construct the effective Hamiltonian.
#
# Effective Hamiltonian
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# We now construct the effective Hamiltonian by importing the electron integral results and using
# WEST:
#
# .. code-block:: python
#
#    from westpy.qdet import QDETResult
#
#    effective_hamiltonian = QDETResult(filename='west.wfreq.save/wfreq.json')
#
# The effective Hamiltonian can be solved using a high level method such as the full configuration
# interaction (FCI) algorithm from WEST as:
#
# .. code-block:: python
#
#    solution = effective_hamiltonian.solve()
#
# Using :code:`solve()` prints the excitation energies, spin multiplicity and relative occupation of
# the active orbitals.
#
# .. code-block:: python

# The solution object is a dictionary that contains information about the FCI eigenstates of the
# system, which includes various excitation energies, spin multiplicities, eigenvectors etc.
# More importantly, while FCI handles small embedded effective Hamiltonians with ease, it quickly
# hits a wall with larger impurities. This is precisely where quantum computing steps in, offering
# the scalability needed to tackle such complex systems. The first step to solving these effective
# Hamiltonians via quantum algorithms in PennyLane, is to convert them to qubit Hamiltonians.
#
# Quantum Simulation
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# We now map the effective Hamiltonian to the qubit basis. Note that the two-electron obtained
# before are represented in chemists' notation and need to be converted to the physicists' notation
# for compatibility with PennyLane. Here's how to construct the qubit Hamiltonian:
#
# .. code-block:: python
#
#    from pennylane.qchem import one_particle, two_particle, observable
#    import numpy as np
#
#    effective_hamiltonian = QDETResult(filename="west.wfreq.save/wfreq.json")
#
#    one_e, two_e = effective_hamiltonian.h1e, effective_hamiltonian.eri
#
#    t = one_particle(one_e[0])
#    v = two_particle(np.swapaxes(two_e[0][0], 1, 3))
#    qubit_op = observable([t, v], mapping="jordan_wigner")
#
# We can use this Hamiltonian in a quantum algorithm such as quantum phase estimation (QPE).
# As an exercise, you can compare the results and verify that the computed energies from quantum algorithm
# match those that we obtained before.
#
# Conclusion
# ----------
# Quantum defect embedding theory is a novel framework for simulating strongly correlated
# quantum systems and has been successfully used for studying defects in solids. Applicability of
# QDET however is not limited to defects, it can be used for other systems where a strongly
# correlated subsystem is embedded in a weakly correlated environment. Additionally, QDET is able to
# correct the interaction double counting issue within the active space faced by a variety of
# other embedding theories. The Green's function based formulation of QDET ensures
# exact removal of double counting corrections at GW level of theory, thus removing the
# approximation present in the initial DFT based formulation. This formulation also helps to capture
# the response properties and provides access to excited state properties. Another major advantage
# of QDET is the ease with which it can be used with quantum computers in a hybrid framework [#Baker]_.
# In conclusion, QDET is a powerful embedding approach for simulating complex quantum systems.

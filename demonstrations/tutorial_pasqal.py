Quantum computing architectures come in many flavours: superconducting qubits, ion traps, photonics, silicon, and more. One really interesting physical substrate is *neutral atoms*. These quantum devices have some similarities to ion-traps. Ion-trap devices make use of atoms that have an imbalance between protons (positively charged) and electrons (negatively charged). Neutral atoms, on the other hand, have an equal number of protons and electrons. 

In neutral-atom systems, you can use lasers to arrange atoms in various two- or 
three-dimensional configurations. This opens up some very interesting possibilities for 
exotic quantum computing circuit topologies, as can be seen in the image below:

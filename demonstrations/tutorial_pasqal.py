Quantum computing architectures come in many flavours: superconducting qubits, ion traps,
photonics, silicon, and more. One very interesting physical substrate is *neutral atoms*. These
quantum devices have some basic similarities to ion traps. Ion-trap devices make use of atoms
that have an imbalance between protons (positively charged) and electrons (negatively charged).
Neutral atoms, on the other hand, have an equal number of protons and electrons.

In neutral-atom systems, the individual atoms can be easily programmed into various two- or
three-dimensional configurations. Like ion-trap systems, individual qubits can be encoded into
the energy levels of the atoms. The qubits thus retain the three-dimensional geometry of their
host atoms. Qubits that are nearby in space can be programmed to interact with one another
via two-qubit gates. This opens up some tantalizing possibilities for exotic quantum-computing
circuit topologies.

The startup `Pasqal <https://pasqal.io/>`_ is one of the companies working to bring
neutral-atom quantum computing devices to the world. To support this new class of devices,
Pasqal has contributed some new features to the quantum software library `Cirq <https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.

In this demo, we will use PennyLane, Cirq, and TensorFlow to show off the unique abilities of
neutral atom devices, leveraging them to make a variational quantum circuit which has a
very unique topology: *the Eiffel tower*. Specifically, we will build a simple toy
circuit whose qubits are arranged like the Eiffel tower. The girders between
the points on the tower will represent two-qubit gates, with the final output of our
variational circuit coming at the very peak of the tower.

Let's get to it!

# path where you have saved the downloaded data).

# Converting to Cirq qubits
# -------------------------
#
# Our next step will be to convert these datapoints into objects that
# Cirq understands as qubits. For neutral-atom devices in Cirq, we can use the
# ``ThreeDQubit`` class, which carries information about the three-dimensional
# arrangement of the qubits.
#
# Now, neutral-atom devices come with some physical restrictions.
# Specifically, in a particular three-dimensional configuration, qubits that
# are too distant from one another can't easily interact. Instead, there is
# a notion of a *control radius;* any atoms which are within the system's
# control radius can interact with one another. Qubits separated by a
# distance larger than the control radius cannot interact.
#
# In order to allow our Eiffel tower qubits to interact with
# one another more easily, we will artificially scale some dimensions
# when placing the atoms.

# Creating a quantum circuit
# --------------------------
#
# We will now make a variational circuit out of the Eiffel tower configuration
# from above. Each of the 9 qubits we are using can be thought of
# as a single wire in a quantum circuit. We will cause these qubits to interact by applying
# a sequence of two-qubit gates. Specifically, the circuit consists of several
# stages:
#
# i. Input classical data is converted into quantum information at the first
#    (lowest) vertical level of qubits. In this example, our classical data
#    will be simple bit strings, which we can embed by using single-qubit
#    bit flips (a simple
#    `data-embedding <https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/quantum_embedding.html>`_
#    strategy).
#
# ii. For each corner of the tower, CNOTs are enacted between the first-
#     and second-level qubits.
#
# iii. All qubits from the second level interact with a single "peak" qubit
#      using a parametrized controlled-rotation operation. The free parameters
#      of our variational circuit enter here.
#
# The output of our circuit is determined via a Pauli-Z measurement on
# the final "peak" qubit.
#
# That's a few things to keep track of, so let's show the circuit via a
# three-dimensional image:

# Training the circuit
# --------------------
#
# Let's now leverage this variational circuit to tackle a toy classification
# problem.
# For the purposes of this demo, we will consider a very simple classifier:
#
# * if the first input qubit is in the state :math:`\mid 0 \rangle`, the model
#   should make the prediction "0", and
#
# * if the first input qubit is in the state :math:`\mid 1 \rangle`, the model
#   should predict "1" (independent of the states of all other qubits).
#
# In other words, the idealized trained model should learn an
# identity transformation between the first qubit and the final one, while
# ignoring the states of all other qubits.
#
# With this goal in mind, we can create a basic cost function. This cost
# function randomly samples possible 4-bit input bitstrings, and compares
# the circuit's output with the value of the first bit. The other bits
# can be thought of as noise that we don't want our model to learn.

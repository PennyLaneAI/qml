r"""Intro to the BlueQubit (CPU) device 
=============================================================

Here we will show how you can run Pennylane circuits of up to 33 qubits for free on BlueQubit backend.
Running large scale simulations usually requires lots of memory and compute power.
Regular laptops already struggle above 20 qubits and most of the time 30+ qubits are a no go.
Using the BlueQubit device, now Pennylane users can run circuit simulations on souped up machines and go up to 33 qubits!

We use a custom build of Pennilane-Lighning to have multi-threading and other configurations to achieve best possible performance.

.. note::

    To follow along with this tutorial on your own computer, you will need the
    `BlueQubit SDK <https://app.bluequbit.io/sdk-docs/index.html>`_. It can be installed via pip:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install bluequbit

Build your PennyLane circuit
----------------------------

Here we will build a simple :doc:`Bell pair </glossary/what-are-bell-states>` and simulate it on the BlueQubit backend.
Later in this tutorial we will show a larger example — a 26-qubit quantum adder.

Here is the example circuit we will be simulating:
"""

import pennylane as qml
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np


def bell_pair():
    qml.Hadamard(0)
    qml.CNOT(wires=(0, 1))
    return qml.probs()

fig = qml.draw_mpl(bell_pair)()

# Use the BlueQubit device
# ------------------------
# Here are the 3 easy steps to simulate the above circuit on the BlueQubit backend:
#
# 1. Open an account at `app.bluequbit.io <https://app.bluequbit.io/>`__ to get a token. You can also view your submitted jobs here later.
# 2. Initialize the `bluequbit` device with your token.
# 3. Submit the circuit for simulation!

import bluequbit
bluequbit.logger.setLevel("ERROR")

# STEP 2: Initialize the bluequbit device!
# Using a guest token here. Replace it with your own token for a better experience.
bq_dev = qml.device("bluequbit.cpu", wires=2, token="3hmIGLWGKzKdWmxLoJ5F24P3rivGL04d")

bell_qnode = qml.QNode(bell_pair, bq_dev)

# STEP 3: Simulate the circuit!
result = bell_qnode()
print(result)

# And that's it! Circuit details and visualizations will also appear in your BlueQubit account after this run.
#
# Now we can run even larger (up to 33-qubit) circuit simulations the same way!
#
# Larger workloads: 26 qubits
# ---------------------------
# Here we will see a much larger example — a 26-qubit circuit.
# Inspired by `Guillermo Allonso's <https://www.pennylane.ai/profile/ketpuntog>`__ PennyLane Demo `Basic arithmetic with the QFT <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qft_arithmetics>`__,
# which implements a quantum adder in Pennylane, we build our own adder and use it to add together quantum registers.
# 
# In the quantum world we can use the idea of superposition to add multiple numbers at the same time.
# Furthermore, since each number in the superposition can have its own weight, we can use this adder to sum together distributions!
# Below we will use that idea to demonstrate the `central limit theorem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem>`__: we will add together a couple of sequences of independent and identically distributed variables (namely uniformly distributed) 
# and see what their outcome will look like.
# 
# It should take approximately 1 minute to run the code below.

# Wow, that looks like a Gaussian distribution! 
#
# That's exactly what's expected from the central limit theorem — adding together multiple sequences of independent and identically distributed variables approximates the normal distribution.

# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# In this tutorial we saw how PennyLane users can run large circuit simulations on BlueQubit's souped up machines.
# We demonstrated this both on a small example, as well as a large 26-qubit simulation where we added together uniform 
# distributions to approximate a normal distribution.
#
# PennyLane users can now simulate large circuits of up to 33 qubits for free using BlueQubit — we are looking forward to seeing the  
# creative and innovative ways researchers and quantum enthusiasts will be using this capability!

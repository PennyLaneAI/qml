r"""Using the BlueQubit (CPU) device with PennyLane
=============================================================

Running large-scale simulations usually requires lots of memory and compute power, regular laptops already struggle above 20 qubits 
and most of the time 30+ qubits are a no-go.
Using the `BlueQubit device <https://app.bluequbit.io/sdk-docs/index.html>`_, PennyLane users can now run circuit simulations on souped up machines and go up to 33 qubits!
Also, Bluequbit uses a custom build of `PennyLane-Lightning <https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/lightning/en/stable/index.html>`__ that 
enables multi-threading and other configurations to achieve the best possible performance.

Below we will show 2 examples of how to use BlueQubit with PennyLane.
The first is a very simple example building a Bell pair, and the second one is a large 26-qubit circuit that demonstrates the central limit theorem using quantum arithmetic.


.. note::

    To follow along with this tutorial on your own computer, you will need the
    `BlueQubit SDK <https://app.bluequbit.io/sdk-docs/index.html>`_. It can be installed via pip:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install bluequbit

Build your PennyLane circuit
----------------------------

Here we will build a simple :doc:`Bell pair </glossary/what-are-bell-states>` and simulate it on the BlueQubit backend.
Later in this tutorial we will show a larger example — a 26-qubit circuit that demonstrates the central limit theorem using a `Draper QFT adder <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qft_arithmetics>`__.

Here is the example circuit we will be simulating:
"""

import pennylane as qml
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np


def bell_pair():
    qml.Hadamard(0)
    qml.CNOT(wires=(0, 1))
    return qml.probs()

fig = qml.draw_mpl(bell_pair)()

# Use the BlueQubit device
# ------------------------
# Here are the 3 easy steps to simulate the above circuit on the BlueQubit backend:
#
# 1. Open an account at `app.bluequbit.io <https://app.bluequbit.io/>`__ to get a token. You can also view your submitted jobs here later.
# 2. Initialize the `bluequbit` device with your token.
# 3. Submit the circuit for simulation!

import bluequbit
bluequbit.logger.setLevel("ERROR")

# STEP 2: Initialize the bluequbit device!
# Using a guest token here. Replace it with your own token for a better experience.
bq_dev = qml.device("bluequbit.cpu", wires=2, token="3hmIGLWGKzKdWmxLoJ5F24P3rivGL04d")

bell_qnode = qml.QNode(bell_pair, bq_dev)

# STEP 3: Simulate the circuit!
result = bell_qnode()
print(result)

# And that's it! Circuit details and visualizations will also appear in your BlueQubit account after this run.
#
# Now we can run even larger (up to 33-qubit) circuit simulations the same way!
#
# Larger workloads: 26 qubits
# ---------------------------
# Here we will see a much larger example — a 26-qubit circuit.
# Inspired by `Guillermo Allonso's <https://www.pennylane.ai/profile/ketpuntog>`__ PennyLane Demo `Basic arithmetic with the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qft_arithmetics>`__,
# which implements a quantum adder in PennyLane, we build our own adder and use it to add together quantum registers.
# 
# In the quantum world we can use the idea of superposition to add multiple numbers at the same time.
# Furthermore, since each number in the superposition can have its own weight, we can use this adder to sum together distributions!
# Below we will use that idea to demonstrate the `central limit theorem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem>`__: we will add together a couple of sequences of independent and identically distributed variables (namely uniformly distributed) 
# and see what their outcome will look like.
# 
# It should take approximately 1 minute to run the code below.

# Wow, that looks like a Gaussian distribution! 
#
# That's exactly what's expected from the central limit theorem — adding together multiple sequences of independent and identically distributed variables approximates the normal distribution.

#############################################
# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# In this tutorial we saw how PennyLane users can run large circuit simulations on BlueQubit's souped up machines.
# We demonstrated this both on a small example, as well as a large 26-qubit simulation where we added together uniform 
# distributions to approximate a normal distribution.
#
# PennyLane users can now simulate large circuits of up to 33 qubits for free using `BlueQubit <https://app.bluequbit.io/sdk-docs/index.html>`_ — we are looking forward to seeing the  
# creative and innovative ways researchers and quantum enthusiasts will be using this capability!

Kernel methods are one of the cornerstones of classical machine learning.
Here we are concerned with kernels that can be evaluated on quantum computers,
*quantum kernels* for short.
In this tutorial you will learn how to evaluate kernels, use them for classification
and train them with gradient-based optimization, and all that using the
functionality of PennyLane's
`kernels module <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code/qml_kernels.html>`__.
The demo is based on Ref. [#Training_QEKs]_, a project from Xanadu's own
`QHack <https://qhack.ai/>`__ hackathon.

What are kernel methods?
------------------------

To understand what a kernel method does, let's first revisit
one of the simplest methods to assign binary labels to datapoints:
linear classification.

Imagine we want to discern two different classes of points that lie in
different corners of the plane. A linear classifier corresponds to
drawing a line and assigning different labels to the regions on opposing
sides of the line:

.. figure:: ../demonstrations/kernels_module/linear_classification.png
   :align: center
   :width: 30%

We can mathematically formalize this by assigning the label :math:`y`
via

.. math::
   y(\boldsymbol{x}) = \operatorname{sgn}(\langle \boldsymbol{w}, \boldsymbol{x}\rangle + b).

The vector :math:`\boldsymbol{w}` points perpendicular to the line and
thus determine its slope. The independent term :math:`b` specifies the
position on the plane. In this form, linear classification can also be
extended to higher dimensional vectors :math:`\boldsymbol{x}`, where a
line does not divide the entire space into two regions anymore. Instead
one needs a *hyperplane*. It is immediately clear that this method is
not very powerful, as datasets that are not separable by a hyperplane
can't be classified without error.

We can actually sneak around this limitation by performing a neat trick:
if we define some map :math:`\phi(\boldsymbol{x})` that *embeds* our
datapoints into a larger *feature space* and then perform linear
classification there, we could actually realise non-linear
classification in our original space!

.. figure:: ../demonstrations/kernels_module/embedding_nonlinear_classification.png
   :align: center
   :width: 65%

If we go back to the expression for our prediction and include the
embedding, we get

.. math::
   y(\boldsymbol{x}) = \operatorname{sgn}(\langle \boldsymbol{w}, \phi(\boldsymbol{x})\rangle + b).

We will forgo one tiny step, but it can be shown that for the purpose
of optimal classification, we can choose the vector defining the
decision boundary as a linear combination of the embedded datapoints
:math:`\boldsymbol{w} = \sum_i \alpha_i \phi(\boldsymbol{x}_i)`. Putting
this into the formula yields

.. math::
   y(\boldsymbol{x}) = \operatorname{sgn}\left(\sum_i \alpha_i \langle \phi(\boldsymbol{x}_i), \phi(\boldsymbol{x})\rangle + b\right).

This rewriting might not seem useful at first, but notice the above
formula only contains inner products between vectors in the embedding
space:

.. math::
   k(\boldsymbol{x}_i, \boldsymbol{x}_j) = \langle \phi(\boldsymbol{x}_i), \phi(\boldsymbol{x}_j)\rangle.

We call this function the *kernel*. It provides the advantage that we can often
find an explicit formula for the kernel :math:`k` that makes it
superfluous to actually perform the (potentially expensive) embedding
:math:`\phi`. Consider for example the following embedding and the
associated kernel:

.. math::
   \phi((x_1, x_2)) &= (x_1^2, \sqrt{2} x_1 x_2, x_2^2) \\
   k(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{y}) &= x_1^2 y_1^2 + 2 x_1 x_2 y_1 y_2 + x_2^2 y_2^2 = \langle \boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{y} \rangle^2.

This means by just replacing the regular scalar product in our linear
classification with the map :math:`k`, we can actually express much more
intricate decision boundaries!

This is very important, because in many interesting cases the embedding :math:`\phi`
will be much costlier to compute than the kernel :math:`k`.

In this demo, we will explore one particular kind of kernel
that can be realized on near-term quantum computers, namely *Quantum
Embedding Kernels (QEKs)*. These are kernels that arise from embedding
data into the space of quantum states. We formalize this by considering
a parameterised quantum circuit :math:`U(\boldsymbol{x})` that maps
a datapoint :math:`\boldsymbol{x}` to the state

.. math::
   |\psi(\boldsymbol{x})\rangle = U(\boldsymbol{x}) |0 \rangle.

The kernel value is then given by the *overlap* of the associated
embedded quantum states

.. math::
   k(\boldsymbol{x}_i, \boldsymbol{x}_j) = | \langle\psi(\boldsymbol{x}_i)|\psi(\boldsymbol{x}_j)\rangle|^2.

# Defining a Quantum Embedding Kernel
# -----------------------------------
# PennyLane's `kernels module <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code/qml_kernels.html>`__
# allows for a particularly simple
# implementation of Quantum Embedding Kernels. The first ingredient we
# need for this is an *ansatz*, which we will construct by repeating a
# layer as building block. Let's start by defining this layer:

import pennylane as qml


def layer(x, params, wires, i0=0, inc=1):

    qml.broadcast(unitary=qml.CRZ, pattern="ring", wires=wires, parameters=params[1])


##############################################################################
# To construct the ansatz, this layer is repeated multiple times, reusing
# the datapoint ``x`` but feeding different variational
# parameters ``params`` into each of them.
# Together, the datapoint and the variational parameters fully determine
# the embedding ansatz :math:`U(\boldsymbol{x})`.
# In order to construct the full kernel circuit, we also require its adjoint
# :math:`U(\boldsymbol{x})^\dagger`, which we can obtain via ``qml.adjoint``.


def ansatz(x, params, wires):
    """The embedding ansatz"""

##############################################################################
# Together with the ansatz we only need a device to run the quantum circuit on.
# For the purpose of this tutorial we will use PennyLane's ``default.qubit``
# device with 5 wires in analytic mode.

dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=5, shots=None)
wires = dev.wires.tolist()

##############################################################################
# Let us now define the quantum circuit that realizes the kernel. We will compute
# the overlap of the quantum states by first applying the embedding of the first
# datapoint and then the adjoint of the embedding of the second datapoint. We
# finally extract the probabilities of observing each basis state.


@qml.qnode(dev)

# The kernel function itself is now obtained by looking at the probability
# of observing the all-zero state at the end of the kernel circuit -- because
# of the ordering in ``qml.probs``, this is the first entry:

    return kernel_circuit(x1, x2, params)[0]


##############################################################################
#
# .. note::
#     An alternative way to set up the kernel circuit in PennyLane would be
#     to use the observable type
#     `Projector <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code/api/pennylane.Projector.html>`__.
#     This is shown in the
#     `demo on kernel-based training of quantum models <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_kernel_based_training.html>`__, where you will also find more
#     background information on the kernel circuit structure itself.
#
# Before focusing on the kernel values we have to provide values for the
# variational parameters. At this point we fix the number of layers in the
# ansatz circuit to :math:`6`.

##############################################################################
# The mutual kernel values between all elements of the dataset form the

# method, which makes use of symmetry of the kernel,
# :math:`k(\boldsymbol{x}_i,\boldsymbol{x}_j) = k(\boldsymbol{x}_j, \boldsymbol{x}_i)`.
# In addition, the option ``assume_normalized_kernel=True`` ensures that we do not
# calculate the entries between the same datapoints, as we know them to be 1
# for our noiseless simulation. Overall this means that we compute
# :math:`\frac{1}{2}(N^2-N)` kernel values for :math:`N` datapoints.
# To include the variational parameters, we construct a ``lambda`` function that
# fixes them to the values we sampled above.

##############################################################################
# Using the Quantum Embedding Kernel for predictions
# --------------------------------------------------
# The quantum kernel alone can not be used to make predictions on a
# dataset, becaues it is essentially just a tool to measure the similarity
# between two datapoints. To perform an actual prediction we will make use
# of scikit-learn's Support Vector Classifier (SVC).

from sklearn.svm import SVC

##############################################################################
# To construct the SVM, we need to supply ``sklearn.svm.SVC`` with a function
# that takes two sets of datapoints and returns the associated kernel matrix.
# We can make use of the function ``qml.kernels.kernel_matrix`` that provides
# this functionality. It expects the kernel to not have additional parameters
# besides the datapoints, which is why we again supply the variational
# parameters via the ``lambda`` function from above.
# Once we have this, we can let scikit-learn adjust the SVM from our Quantum
# Embedding Kernel.
#
# .. note::
#     This step does *not* modify the variational parameters in our circuit
#     ansatz. What it does is solving a different optimization task for the
#     :math:`\alpha` and :math:`b` vectors we introduced in the beginning.

svm = SVC(kernel=lambda X1, X2: qml.kernels.kernel_matrix(X1, X2, init_kernel)).fit(X, Y)

##############################################################################
# We are also interested in seeing what the decision boundaries in this

##############################################################################
# We see the outer points in the dataset can be correctly classified, but
# we still struggle with the inner circle. But remember we have a circuit
# with many free parameters! It is reasonable to believe we can give
# values to those variational parameters which improve the overall accuracy
# of our SVC.
#
# Training the Quantum Embedding Kernel
# -------------------------------------
#
# To be able to train the Quantum Embedding Kernel we need some measure of
# how well it fits the dataset in question. Performing an exhaustive
# search in parameter space is not a good solution because it is very
# resource intensive, and since the accuracy is a discrete quantity we
# would not be able to detect small improvements.
#
# We can, however, resort to a more specialized measure, the
# *kernel-target alignment* [#Alignment]_. The kernel-target alignment compares the
# similarity predicted by the quantum kernel to the actual labels of the
# training data. It is based on *kernel alignment*, a similiarity measure
# between two kernels with given kernel matrices :math:`K_1` and
# :math:`K_2`:
#
# .. math::
#    \operatorname{KA}(K_1, K_2) = \frac{\operatorname{Tr}(K_1 K_2)}{\sqrt{\operatorname{Tr}(K_1^2)\operatorname{Tr}(K_2^2)}}.
#
# .. note::
#     Seen from a more theoretical side, :math:`\operatorname{KA}`
#     is nothing else than the cosine of the angle between the kernel
#     matrices :math:`K_1` and :math:`K_2` if we see them as vectors
#     in the space of matrices with the Hilbert-Schmidt (or
#     Frobenius) scalar product
#     :math:`\langle A, B \rangle = \operatorname{Tr}(A^T B)`. This
#     reinforces the geometric picture of how this measure relates
#     to objects, namely two kernels, being aligned in a vector space.
#
# The training data enters the picture by defining an *ideal* kernel
# function that expresses the original labelling in the vector
# :math:`\boldsymbol{y}` by assigning to two datapoints the product
# of the corresponding labels:
#
# .. math::
#    k_{\boldsymbol{y}}(\boldsymbol{x}_i, \boldsymbol{x}_j) = y_i y_j.
#
# The assigned kernel is thus :math:`+1` if both datapoints lie in the
# same class and :math:`-1` otherwise and its kernel matrix is simply
# given by the outer product :math:`\boldsymbol{y}\boldsymbol{y}^T`.
# The kernel-target alignment is then defined as the kernel alignment
# of the kernel matrix :math:`K` generated by the
# quantum kernel and :math:`\boldsymbol{y}\boldsymbol{y}^T`:
#
# .. math::
#        \operatorname{KTA}_{\boldsymbol{y}}(K)
#        = \frac{\operatorname{Tr}(K \boldsymbol{y}\boldsymbol{y}^T)}{\sqrt{\operatorname{Tr}(K^2)\operatorname{Tr}((\boldsymbol{y}\boldsymbol{y}^T)^2)}}
#        = \frac{\boldsymbol{y}^T K \boldsymbol{y}}{\sqrt{\operatorname{Tr}(K^2)} N}
#
# where :math:`N` is the number of elements in :math:`\boldsymbol{y}`,
# that is the number of datapoints in the dataset.
#
# In summary, the kernel-target alignment effectively captures how well
# the kernel you chose reproduces the actual similarities of the data. It
# does have one drawback, however: having a high kernel-target alignment
# is only a necessary but not a sufficient condition for a good
# performance of the kernel [#Alignment]_. This means having good alignment is
# guaranteed for good performance, but optimal alignment will not always
# bring optimal training accuracy with it.
#
# Let's now come back to the actual implementation. PennyLane's
# ``kernels`` module allows you to easily evaluate the kernel
# target alignment:

kta_init = qml.kernels.target_alignment(X, Y, init_kernel, assume_normalized_kernel=True)

print(f"The kernel-target alignment for our dataset and random parameters is {kta_init:.3f}")

##############################################################################
# Now let's code up an optimization loop and improve the kernel-target alignment!
#
# We will make use of regular gradient descent optimization. To speed up
# the optimization we will not use the entire training set to compute
# :math:`\operatorname{KTA}` but rather
# sample smaller subsets of the data at each step, we choose :math:`4`
# datapoints at random. Remember that PennyLane's built-in optimizer works
# to *minimize* the cost function that is given to it, which is why we
# have to multiply the kernel target alignment by :math:`-1` to actually
# *maximize* it in the process.
#
# .. note::
#     Currently, the function ``qml.kernels.target_alignment`` is not
#     differentiable yet, making it unfit for gradient descent optimization.
#     We therefore first define a differentiable version of this function.

In the paper `Quantum supremacy using a programmable superconducting
processor <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5>`__, the
Google AI Quantum team and collaborators showed that the Sycamore quantum processor could
complete a task that would take a classical computer potentially thousands
of years. They faced their quantum chip off against JEWEL---one of the
world's most powerful supercomputers---using a classical statevector simulator called
`qsim <https://github.com/quantumlib/qsim>`__. The main idea behind this
showdown was to prove that a quantum device could solve a specific task
that no classical method could do in a reasonable amount of time.

For the face-off, a pseudo-random quantum circuit was constructed by alternating
single-qubit and two-qubit gates in a specific, semi-random pattern. This
procedure gives a random unitary transformation which is
compatible with the Sycamore hardware. The circuit output is
measured many times, producing a set of sampled bitstrings.
The more qubits there are, and the deeper the circuit is, the more difficult
it becomes to simulate and sample this
bitstring distribution classically. By comparing run-times for the
classical simulations and the Sycamore chip
on smaller circuits, and then extrapolating classical run-times for larger
circuits, the team concluded that simulating larger circuits on Sycamore
was intractable classically---i.e., the Sycamore chips had demonstrated
what is called "quantum supremacy".

In this demonstration, we will walk you through how their random quantum
circuits were constructed, how the performance was measured via
cross-entropy benchmarks, and provide reusable examples of their classical
simulations.

.. note::

    We will be using PennyLane along with the aformentioned
    ``qsim`` simulator running via our `PennyLane-Cirq plugin
    <https://pennylane-cirq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__. To use the ``qsim``
    device you also need to install ``qsimcirq``, which is the Python module
    interfacing the ``qsim`` simulator with Cirq.

# Preparations
# ------------
#
# As always, we begin by importing the necessary modules. We will use
# PennyLane, along with some PennyLane-Cirq specific operations, as well as
# Cirq.
#

import pennylane as qml
from pennylane_cirq import ops

import cirq
import numpy as np


######################################################################
# To start, we need to define the qubit grid that we will use for mimicking
# Google's Sycamore chip, although we will only use 12 qubits instead of
# the 54 that the actual chip has. This is so that you can run
# this demo without having access to a supercomputer!
#
# We define the 12 qubits in a rectangular grid, setting the coordinates for
# each qubit following the paper's suplementary dataset [#Martinis2020]_. We also create
# a mapping between the wire number and the Cirq qubit to more easily reference
# specific qubits later. Feel free to play around with different grids and
# number of qubits. Just keep in mind that the grid needs to stay
# connected. You could, for example, remove the final row (last four qubits
# in the list) to simulate an 8-qubit system.
#

qubits = sorted([
    cirq.GridQubit(3, 3),
    cirq.GridQubit(3, 4),
    cirq.GridQubit(3, 5),
    cirq.GridQubit(3, 6),
    cirq.GridQubit(4, 3),
    cirq.GridQubit(4, 4),
    cirq.GridQubit(4, 5),
    cirq.GridQubit(4, 6),
    cirq.GridQubit(5, 3),
    cirq.GridQubit(5, 4),
    cirq.GridQubit(5, 5),
    cirq.GridQubit(5, 6),
])

wires = len(qubits)

# create a mapping between wire number and Cirq qubit
qb2wire = {i: j for i, j in zip(qubits, range(wires))}


######################################################################
# Now let's create the ``qsim`` device, available via the Cirq plugin, making
# use of the ``wires`` and ``qubits`` keywords that we defined above.
# First, we need to define the number of 'shots' per circuit instance to
# be used---where the number of shots simply corresponds to the number
# of times that the circuit is sampled. This will also be needed later when
# calculating the cross-entropy benchmarking fidelity. The more shots, the
# more accurate the results will be. 500,000 shots will be used here---the same
# number of samples used in the paper---but feel free to
# change this (depending on your own computational restrictions).
#

shots = 500000
dev = qml.device('cirq.qsim', wires=wires, qubits=qubits, shots=shots)


######################################################################
# The next step would be to prepare the necessary gates. Some of these
# gates are not natively supported in PennyLane, but are accessible
# through the Cirq plugin. We can define the remaining gates by hand.
#
# For the single-qubit gates we need the :math:`\sqrt{X}` and
# :math:`\sqrt{Y}` gates, which can be written as :math:`RX(\pi/2)` and
# :math:`RY(\pi/2)` respectively, as well as the :math:`\sqrt{W}` gate,
# where :math:`W = \frac{X + Y}{2}`. The latter is easiest defined by its
# unitary matrix
#
# .. math::
#
#    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
#    \begin{bmatrix}
#       1 & \sqrt{i}  \\
#       \sqrt{-i} & 1 \\
#    \end{bmatrix}.
#
# The :math:`\sqrt{X}` gate is already implemented in PennyLane, while the
# two other gates can be implemented as follows:

sqrtYgate = lambda wires: qml.RY(np.pi / 2, wires=wires)

sqrtWgate = lambda wires: qml.QubitUnitary(
    np.array([[1,  -np.sqrt(1j)],
              [np.sqrt(-1j), 1]]) / np.sqrt(2), wires=wires
)

single_qubit_gates = [qml.SX, sqrtYgate, sqrtWgate]


######################################################################
# For the two-qubit gates we need the iSWAP gate
#
# .. math::
#
#    \begin{bmatrix}
#       1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
#       0 & 0 & i & 0 \\
#       0 & i & 0 & 0 \\
#       0 & 0 & 0 & 1
#    \end{bmatrix},
#
# as well as the CPhase gate
#
# .. math::
#
#    \begin{bmatrix}
#       1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
#       0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
#       0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
#       0 & 0 & 0 & e^{-i\phi}
#    \end{bmatrix},
#
# both accessible via the Cirq plugin.
#


######################################################################
# Assembling the circuit
# ----------------------
#
# Here comes one of the tricky parts. To decide which qubits the
# two-qubit gates should be applied to, we have to look at how they are
# connected to each other. In an alternating pattern, each pair of
# neighbouring qubits gets labeled with a letter A-D, where A and B
# correspond to all horizontally neighbouring qubits (in a row), and C and
# D to the vertically neighbouring qubits (in a column). This is depicted
# in the figure below, where you can also see how the single-qubit gates
# are applied, as well as the cycles, each consisting of a layer of
# single-qubit gates and a pair of two-qubit gates. Note that each coloured
# two-qubit gate represented in the image is implemented as the two
# consecutive gates iSWAP and CPhase in this demo.

#
#     **Image taken from Arute, F., Arya, K., Babbush, R. et al.** [#Arute2019]_
#
# The logic below iterates through all connections and returns a
# dictionary, ``gate_order``, where the keys are the connection labels
# between different qubits and the values are lists of all neighbouring
# qubit pairs. We will use this dictionary inside the circuit to iterate
# through the different pairs and apply the two two-qubit gates that we
# just defined above. The way we iterate through the dictionary will depend
# on a gate sequence defined in the next section.
#

from itertools import combinations

gate_order = {"A":[], "B":[], "C":[], "D":[]}
for i, j in combinations(qubits, 2):
    wire_1 = qb2wire[i]
    wire_2 = qb2wire[j]
    if i in j.neighbors():
        if i.row == j.row and i.col % 2 == 0:
            gate_order["A"].append((wire_1, wire_2))
        elif i.row == j.row and j.col % 2 == 0:
            gate_order["B"].append((wire_1, wire_2))
        elif i.col == j.col and i.row % 2 == 0:
            gate_order["C"].append((wire_1, wire_2))
        elif i.col == j.col and j.row % 2 == 0:
            gate_order["D"].append((wire_1, wire_2))


######################################################################
# At this point we can define the gate sequence, which is the order the
# two-qubit gates are applied to the different qubit pairs. For example,
# ``["A", "B"]`` would mean that the two-qubit gates are first applied to
# all qubits connected with label A, and then, during the next full cycle,
# the two-qubit gates are applied to all qubits connected with label B.
# This would then correspond to a 2-cycle run (or a circuit with a depth of
# 2).
#
# While we can define any patterns we'd like, the two gate sequences below
# are the ones that are used in the paper. The shorter one is
# used for their classically verifiable benchmarking. The slightly
# longer sequence, which is much harder to simulate classically, is used
# for estimating the cross-entropy fidelity in what they call the "supremacy
# regime". We will use the shorter gate sequence for the following
# demonstration; feel free to play around with other combinations.
#

m = 14  # number of cycles

gate_sequence_longer = np.resize(["A", "B", "C", "D", "C", "D", "A", "B"], m)
gate_sequence = np.resize(["A", "B", "C", "D"], m)


######################################################################
# The single-qubit gates are randomly selected and applied to each qubit in
# the circuit, while avoiding the same gate being applied to the same wire
# twice in a row. We do this by creating a helper function ``generate_single_qubit_gate_list()`` that
# specifies the order in which the single-qubit
# gates should be applied. We can use this list within the
# circuit to know which gate to apply when.
#

def generate_single_qubit_gate_list():
    # create the first list by randomly selecting indices
    # from single_qubit_gates
    g = [list(np.random.choice(range(len(single_qubit_gates)), size=wires))]

    for cycle in range(len(gate_sequence)):
        g.append([])
        for w in range(wires):
            # check which gate was applied to the wire previously
            one_gate_removed = list(range(len(single_qubit_gates)))
            bool_list = np.array(one_gate_removed) == g[cycle][w]

            # and remove it from the choices of gates to be applied
            pop_idx = np.where(bool_list)[0][0]
            one_gate_removed.pop(pop_idx)
            g[cycle + 1].append(np.random.choice(one_gate_removed))
    return g


######################################################################
# Finally, we can define the circuit itself and create a QNode that we will
# use for circuit evaluation with the ``qsim`` device. The two-qubit gates
# are applied to the qubits connected by A, B, C, or D as defined above.
# The circuit ends with a half-cycle, consisting of only a layer of
# single-qubit gates.
#
# From the QNode, we need both the probabilities of the measurement
# results, as well as raw samples. To facilitate this, we add a keyword
# argument to our circuit allowing us to switch between the two returns. We
# sample from the Pauli-Z observable on all wires, which will give us the
# eigenvalues :math:`\pm 1` of the observable, corresponding to the states
# :math:`\left|0\right>` and :math:`\left|1\right>`.

# The cross-entropy benchmarking fidelity
# ---------------------------------------
#
# The performance metric that is used in the experiment, and the one that we
# will use in this demo, is called the linear cross-entropy benchmarking
# fidelity. It's defined as
#
# .. math::
#
#    F_{XEB} = 2^{n}\left<P(x_i)\right> - 1,
#
# where :math:`n` is the number of qubits, :math:`P(x_i)` is the
# probability of bitstring :math:`x_i` computed for the ideal quantum
# circuit, and the average is over the observed bitstrings.
#
# The idea behind using this fidelity is that it will be close to 1 for
# samples obtained from random quantum circuits, such as the one we defined
# above, and close to zero for a uniform probability distribution, which
# can be effectively sampled from classically. Sampling a bitstring from a
# random quantum circuit would follow the distribution
#
# .. math::
#
#    Pr(p) = (N - 1)(1- p)^{N-2},
#
# where :math:`N = 2^n` is the number of possible bitstrings [#Boixo2018]_.
# This distribution is approximated well by the Porter-Thomas distribution,
# given by :math:`Pr(p) = Ne^{-Np}`, a characteristic property of chaotic quantum
# systems. From this we can then calculate the expectation value
# :math:`\left<P(x_i)\right>` as follows:
#
# .. math::
#
#    \left<P(x_i)\right> = \int_0^1 p^2 N (N-1)(1-p)^{N-2}dp = \frac{2}{N+1},
#
# which leads to the theoretical fidelity
#
# .. math::
#
#    F_{XEB} = 2^{n}\left<P(x_i)\right> - 1 = \frac{2N}{N+1} - 1.
#
# We implement this fidelity as the function below, where ``samples`` is a
# list of sampled bitstrings, and ``probs`` is a list with corresponding
# sampling probabilities for the same noiseless circuit.
#

def fidelity_xeb(samples, probs):
    sampled_probs = []
    for bitstring in samples:
        # convert each bitstring into an integer

        # retrieve the corresponding probability for the bitstring
        sampled_probs.append(probs[bitstring_idx])

    return 2 ** len(samples[0]) * np.mean(sampled_probs) - 1

#
#     The cross-entropy benchmarking fidelity may output
#     values that are negative or that are larger than 1, for any finite
#     number of samples. This is due to the random nature of the sampling.
#     For an infinite amount of samples, or circuit runs, the observed

# Classical hardness
# ------------------
#
# Why are we calculating this specific fidelity, and what does it actually
# mean if we get a cross-entropy benchmarking fidelity close to 1? This is
# an important question, containing one of the main arguments behind why
# this experiment is used to demonstrate "quantum supremacy".
#
# Much is due to the Porter-Thompson probability distribution that the
# random quantum circuits follow, which is hard to simulate classically.
# On the other hand, a quantum device, running a circuit as the one
# constructed above, should be able to sample from such a distribution
# without much overhead. Thus, by showing that a quantum device can produce
# a high enough fidelity value for a large enough circuit, "quantum
# supremacy" can be claimed. This is exactly what Google's experiment
# has done.
#
# There's still one issue that hasn't been touched on yet: the addition of
# noise in quantum hardware. Simply put, this noise will lower the
# cross-entropy benchmarking fidelity---the larger the
# circuit, the more noise there will be, and thus the lower the fidelity, with the
# fidelity approaching 0 as the noise increases.
# By calculating the specific single-qubit, two-qubit, and readout errors
# of the Sycamore chip, and using them to simulate a noisy circuit, the Google
# AI quantum team was able to compare the run-times with the output from
# their actual hardware device. This way, they managed to show that a
# significant speedup could be gained from using a quantum computer, and
# thus proclaimed "quantum supremacy" (see Fig. 4 in [#Arute2019]_).
#
# .. note::
#
#     For more reading on this, the original paper [#Arute2019]_ is highly
#     recommended (along with the suplementary information [#Arute2019sup]_ if you want
#     to dive deeper into the math and physics of the experiment). The blog
#     post in [#Sohaib2019]_, along with the accompanying GitHub repo, also provides
#     a nice introduction to the cross-entropy benchmarking fidelity, and
#     includes calculations highlighting the effects of added noise models.

r"""How to use noise models in PennyLane
------------------------------------

######################################################################
# Noise models are essential in understanding and describing the effects of physical errors in a
# quantum computation. They allow one to perform simulations that help emulate imperfections in the
# evolution of and inference from quantum states under effect of state preparation, measurement and
# environment-based errors.
#
# Here, we introduce how to use the ``noise`` module in PennyLane for constructing and manipulating
# noise models for performing noisy simulation. PennyLane supports what is called insertion-based
# noise models that are defined as a mapping from conditions to quantum function-like callables and
# any additional noise-related metadata. Each condition in the mapping evaluates gate operations in
# the quantum circuit based on some of its attributes like name, parameter values or wires. Depending
# on the outcome of the evaluation, the corresponding callable would apply the noise operations for
# the evaluated gate based on user-provided metadata such as hardware toplogy constraints and
# relaxation/dephasing times.
#

######################################################################
# Letâ€™s understand this briefly with help of the following noise model that inserts an ampltitude and
# phase damping errors for ``RX`` and ``RY`` gates, respectively.

######################################################################
# In the subsequent sections we will explore how much flexibility is available in defining the basic
# components for these noise models and then learn how to construct them in PennyLane. Finally, we
# will see how can they be used in noisy simulations.
#

######################################################################
# Boolean functions
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# We want to implement conditionals as boolean functions that accepts an operation and evaulate it to
# return a boolean output. In PennyLane such objects are constructed as instances of ``BooleanFn`` and
# can combined using standard bitwise operations. From the perspective of noise models, we support
# following type of constructions.
#

######################################################################
# Operation-based conditionals
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# These conditional evaluate an operation based on whether it is a specific type of operation or
# belongs to a specified set of operations. These can be built with ``OpEq`` and ``OpIn`` helper
# methods, where the specific set of operation can be provided as a class, instaniated object or by
# their string representation:
#

import pennylane as qml

cond1 = qml.noise.op_eq("X")
cond2 = qml.noise.op_in(["X", qml.Y, qml.CNOT([0, 1])])

print(f"cond1: {cond1}")
print(f"cond2: {cond2}")

op = qml.Y(0)

print(f"Evaluating conditionals for {op}")
print(f"Result for cond1: {cond1(op)}")
print(f"Result for cond2: {cond2(op)}")

######################################################################
# Wire-based conditionals
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Unlike operation-based conditionals, these evaluate an operation based on whether its wires are
# either equal or belongs to a specified set of wires. These can be built with ``WiresEq`` and
# ``WiresIn`` helper methods, where the specific set of wires can be provided as string or integer
# inputs. Additionally, one can use already built gate operations and their wires will be
# automatically extracted for constructing the wire set:
#

cond3 = qml.noise.wires_eq("aux")
cond4 = qml.noise.wires_in([0, "c", qml.RX(0.123, wires=["w1"])])

print(f"cond3: {cond3}")
print(f"cond4: {cond4}")

op = qml.X("c")

print(f"Evaluating conditionals for {op}")
print(f"Result for cond3: {cond3(op)}")
print(f"Result for cond4: {cond4(op)}")

######################################################################
# Arbitrary conditionals
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Further precise control over evaluation of operations can be achieved by defining a custom
# conditionals in a functional form and wrapped with ``BooleanFn`` decorator. Inputs of such custom
# conditionals must be a single operation for evaluation and optional keyword arguments for accepting
# metadata. For example, a conditional that evaluates ``True`` for ``RX(\phi)`` gate operations with
# :math:``\phi < 1.0`` can be constructed as:
#


@qml.BooleanFn
def rx_condition(op, **metadata):
    return isinstance(op, qml.RX) and op.parameters[0] < 1.0


op1, op2, op3 = qml.RX(0.05, wires=0), qml.RY(0.07, wires=2), qml.RX(2.37, wires="a")

for op in [op1, op2, op3]:
    print(f"Result for {op}: {rx_condition(op)}")

######################################################################
# Combined Conditionals
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# As noted before, the above conditionals can be combined to form a new conditional via bitwise
# operations such as ``&``, ``|``, ``^``, or ``~``. The resulting conditional will evaluate the
# expression in the order of their combination:
#

and_cond = cond2 & cond4
print(and_cond)

op1, op2, op3 = qml.X(wires=0), qml.CNOT(wires=[2, 3]), qml.RY(0.23, wires="c")

for op in [op1, op2, op3]:
    print(f"Result for {op}: {and_cond(op)}")

######################################################################
# Noisy quantum functions
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# If a conditional evaluates to ``True`` on a given operation in the quantum circuit, the
# corresponding quantum function is evaluated that inserts the noise for that operation. One can
# either use a helper constructor ``partial_wires`` function for single operation noise insertion or
# define their own custom quantum function. It should be noted that user-defined functions should have
# the signature ``fn(op, **metadata)``, allowing for dependency on both the evaluated operation and
# metadata specified in the noise model.
#

######################################################################
# Single-instruction noise via partial_wires
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# ``qml.noise.partial_wires`` builds a partially evaluated function based on the given operation with
# all argument frozen except wires. For example, it can be used to create a constant-valued
# over-rotation:
#

rx_constant = qml.noise.partial_wires(qml.RX(0.1, wires=[0]))

for wire in [0, 2, "w1"]:
    print(f"Over-rotation for {wire}: {rx_constant(wire)}")

######################################################################
# Insertion-based noise
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# There are often times when one would want more parameterized control over the noise operations being
# applied. This is possible by defining your own quantum-function with the signature we specified
# above. For example, one can use the following for inserting a thermal relaxation error based on
# ``T_1`` time provided at runtime as a keyword argument.
#


def thermal_func(op, **kwargs):
    qml.ThermalRelaxationError(0.4, kwargs["t1"], 0.2, 0.6, op.wires)


for op, t1 in [(qml.X(0), 0.01), (qml.RZ(1.234, "w1"), 0.02), (qml.S("aux"), 0.03)]:
    with qml.queuing.AnnotatedQueue() as q:
        thermal_func(op, t1=t1)
    print(f"Error for {op}: {q.queue[0]}")

######################################################################
# Custom-ordered noise
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# By default the quantum function defined above would result in error being inserted after the
# operation that evaluates to ``True``. This might not always be ideal and there might be instances
# where the error needs more felixibility with the order. We can attain this flexibility by specifying
# the order ourselves and queuing the operation being evaluated via ``qml.appply`` within the function
# definition. For example, the following noise function sandwiches the target operation within phase
# rotations.
#


def sandwich_func(op, **kwargs):
    qml.RZ(op.parameters[0] * 0.05, op.wires)
    qml.apply(op)
    qml.RZ(-op.parameters[0] * 0.05, op.wires)


for op, t1 in [(qml.RX(6.589, 0), 0.01), (qml.RY(4.237, "w1"), 0.02)]:
    with qml.queuing.AnnotatedQueue() as q:
        sandwich_func(op, t1=t1)
    print(f"Error for {op}: {q.queue}")

# Noise Models
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Now that we have introduced all the main characters of our story, we can finally introduce them in a
# single plot, i.e., use them to build a noise model in PennyLane as a ``qml.NoiseModel`` object as
# given below:
#

# Set up the conditions
fcond1 = qml.noise.op_eq(qml.RX)


@qml.BooleanFn
def fcond2(op, **kwargs):
    return isinstance(op, qml.RY) and op.parameters[0] >= 0.5


fcond3 = qml.noise.op_in(["X", "Y"])

# Set up noisy functions
noise1 = qml.noise.partial_wires(qml.AmplitudeDamping, 0.4)


def noise2(op, **kwargs):
    qml.RZ(op.parameters[0] * 0.05, op.wires)
    qml.apply(op)
    qml.RZ(-op.parameters[0] * 0.05, op.wires)


def noise3(op, **kwargs):
    qml.ThermalRelaxationError(0.4, kwargs["t1"], kwargs["t2"], 0.6, op.wires)


# Set up noise model
noise_model = qml.NoiseModel({fcond1: noise1, fcond2: noise2, fcond3: noise3}, t1=0.04, t2=0.01)
noise_model

######################################################################
# Adding noise models to your workflow
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Now the final remaining ingredient of our story is to learn how to use these noise models. So, a
# noise model once built can be attached to a circuit or device via the ``qml.add_noise`` transform.
# For example, consider the following quantum circuit:
#

qml.drawer.use_style("pennylane")
dev = qml.device("default.mixed", wires=2)


def circuit(params):
    qml.RX(params[0], wires=0)
    qml.RY(params[1], wires=1)
    qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
    qml.RY(params[2], wires=0)
    qml.RX(params[3], wires=1)
    return qml.counts(wires=[0, 1])


qcircuit = qml.QNode(circuit, dev)
params = [0.1, 0.7, 0.8, 0.4]
qml.draw_mpl(qcircuit, decimals=2)(params)

######################################################################
# Now to attach the noise model to this quantum circuit, we can do the following:
#

noisy_circuit = qml.transforms.add_noise(qcircuit, noise_model)
qml.draw_mpl(noisy_circuit, decimals=2)(params)

######################################################################
# Alternatively, one can also attach the noise model instead to the device itself instead of
# transforming the circuit. For this we can again use the ``add_noise`` transform:
#

noisy_dev = qml.transforms.add_noise(dev, noise_model)
noisy_dev_circuit = qml.QNode(circuit, noisy_dev)

######################################################################
# We can check that both of these are equivalent by looking at their outcomes:
#

import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

num_shots = 100000
init_circuit_counts = qcircuit(params, shots=num_shots)
noisy_circuit_counts = noisy_circuit(params, shots=num_shots)
noist_dev_counts = noisy_dev_circuit(params, shots=num_shots)
categories = list(noist_dev_counts.keys())

width = 0.2
bars1 = np.arange(len(categories))
bars2 = bars1 + width
bars3 = bars1 + 2 * width

# Create the bar plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(
    bars1,
    np.array(list(init_circuit_counts.values())) / num_shots,
    width=width,
    label="Initial Results",
)
plt.bar(
    bars2,
    np.array(list(noisy_circuit_counts.values())) / num_shots,
    width=width,
    label="Noisy Circuit",
)
plt.bar(
    bars3, np.array(list(noist_dev_counts.values())) / num_shots, width=width, label="Noisy Device"
)

# Add labels, title, and legend
plt.xlabel("Bitstring")
plt.ylabel("Probabilities")
plt.xticks(bars1 + width / 2, categories)
plt.legend()

# Show the plot
plt.show()

# Conclusion
# ~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Noise models provide a succinct way to describe the behavior of the environment on a quantum
# computation. In PennyLane, we define such models as a mapping of conditionals that select the target
# operation and their corresponding noise operations. These can be constructed with utmost flexibility
# as shown above. Additionally, we also support converting noise models from Qiskit including the ones
# from hardware and fake backends to PennyLane via our pennylane-qiskit plugin. As such models are
# instrumental in capturing the working of quantum hardware, we will continue to improve these
# features in PennyLane, allowing one to develop and test error correction and noise mitigation
# strategies that will ultimately pave the way towards practical and reliable quantum computations.

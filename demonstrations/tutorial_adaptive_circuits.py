The key component of variational quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry is the circuit used to
prepare electronic ground states of a molecule. The variational
quantum eigensolver (VQE) [#peruzzo2014]_, [#yudong2019]_ is the method of choice for performing
such quantum chemistry simulations on quantum devices with few qubits. For a given molecule, the
appropriate circuit can be generated by using a pre-selected wavefunction ansatz, for example, the
unitary coupled cluster with single and double excitations (UCCSD) [#romero2017]_.
Using a pre-constructed ansatz has the disadvantage of reducing performance in favour of generality:
the approach may work well in many cases, but it will not be optimized for a specific problem.
Quantum circuits can also be designed using specialized approaches that build a customized ansatz for

the given molecule. This helps improve performance at the cost of reducing generality.


In this tutorial, you will learn how to **adaptively** build customized quantum chemistry circuits.
This includes a recipe to adaptively select gates that have a significant contribution to
the desired state, while neglecting those that have a small contribution. You will also learn how to use
the functionality in PennyLane for leveraging the sparsity of a molecular Hamiltonian to make the
computation of the expectation values even more efficient. Let's get started!


Quantum chemistry circuits
--------------------------

Quantum circuits for quantum chemistry are often built using a pre-generated circuit ansatz
such as UCCSD [#romero2017]_. In this approach, we include all possible single and double
excitations of electrons from the occupied spin-orbitals of a reference state to the unoccupied
spin-orbitals [#givenstutorial]_. This makes the construction of the ansatz
straightforward for any given molecule. However, in practical applications, only a selected number
of such excitations are necessary to prepare the exact ground state wavefunction. Including all
possible excitations increases the cost of the simulations without improving the accuracy of the
results. This motivates implementing a strategy that allows for approximation of the contribution of the
excitations and selects only those excitations that are found to be important for the given
molecule. This can be done by using adaptive methods to construct a circuit for each given
problem [#grimsley2019]_.

Adaptive circuits
-----------------

The main idea behind building adaptive circuits is to compute the gradients with respect to all
possible excitation gates, and then select gates based on the magnitude of the computed gradients. 

There are different ways to make use of the gradient information, and here we discuss one of
these strategies and apply it to compute the ground state energy of LiH. This method requires constructing the
Hamiltonian and determining all possible excitations, which we can do with functionality built-in to PennyLane.
But we first need to define the molecular parameters
including atomic symbols and coordinates. Note that the atomic coordinates are in
`Bohr <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_radius>`_.

# simulation times. We use the implemented functionality in PennyLane for computing the expectation
# value of the sparse Hamiltonian observable. This can reduce the cost of simulations by
# orders of magnitude depending on the molecular size. We use the selected gates in the previous
# steps and perform the final optimization step with the sparse method.

# Conclusions
# -----------
# We have learnt that building quantum chemistry circuits adaptively and using the
# functionality for sparse objects makes molecular simulations significantly more efficient. In this
# tutorial, we followed an adaptive strategy that selects a group of gates at each time. This method
# can be extended such that the gates are selected one at time [#grimsley2019]_, or
# even to other more elaborate strategies.

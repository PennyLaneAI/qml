Quantum computers promise a significant speedup in simulating molecular electronic structures for
systems that are intractable with classical quantum chemistry algorithms. The variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE) [#peruzzo2014]_, [#yudong2019]_ is the method of choice for performing such
quantum chemistry simulations on near-term quantum devices. The key component of the VQE algorithm
is to prepare the quantum state describing the ground electronic state of a molecule on a quantum
device. Preparation of the quantum state requires a quantum circuit that is composed of a certain
number of gates applied to an initial reference state. For a given molecule, the appropriate circuit
can be generated by using a pre-selected wavefunction ansatz or it can be generated via a
specialized approach that builds a customized ansatz for the given molecule. Using a pre-constructed
ansatz has the disadvantage of reducing performance in favour of generality while building a
customized circuit helps with improving performance in the cost of reducing generality.

In this tutorial you will learn how to build customized quantum chemistry circuits adaptively. This
includes a recipe for adaptive selection of the gates that have a significant contribution to the
desired state and neglecting those which have zero or small contribution. You also learn to use
the functionality in PennyLane for leveraging the sparsity of a molecular Hamiltonian to make the
computation of the expectation values even more efficient. Let’s get started!

Quantum chemistry circuits
--------------------------

Quantum chemistry circuits are typically build using a pre-generated wavefunction ansatz such as
UCCSD. In this approach, one includes all possible single and double excitations of electrons from
the occupied spin-orbitals of a reference state to the unoccupied spin-orbitals. This makes
construction of the ansatz straightforward for any given molecule. However, we know that in
practical applications, only a selected number of such excitations are necessary to prepare the
exact ground state wavefunction and including all possible excitations increases the cost of the
simulations without improving the accuracy of the results. This motivates implementing an strategy
that allows approximating the contribution of the excitations and select only those excitations
that are found to be important for the given molecule. This can be done by using adaptive methods
to construct a circuit for each given problem [#grimsley2019]_.

Adaptive circuits
-----------------

The main idea behind building adaptive circuits is to compute the gradients of the expectation
value of a molecular Hamiltonian with respect to all the existing the excitation gates and select
gates based on the magnitude of the computed gradients. There are different ways to select the gates
based on the computed gradients and here we discuss one of these strategies to compute the ground
state energy of LiH. Both of these methods require constructing the Hamiltonian
and determining all possible excitations which we can do with PennyLane functionalities shown below.
But we first need to import the required libraries and define the molecular parameters including
atomic symbols and coordinates. Note that the atomic coordinates are in Bohr.

# returns the matrix in the scipy 'sparse coordinate <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.coo_matrix.html>'_ format.

# We can already see that the matrix has 1048576 entries which only 11264 of them
# are non-zero. Leveraging this sparsity in the VQE simulations can significantly reduce the
# simulation times. We use the implemented functionality in PennyLane for computing the expectation
# value of the sparse Hamiltonian observable. This can reduce the cost of the VQE simulations by
# orders of magnitude depending on the molecular size. We use the selected gates in the previous
# steps and perform the final VQE step with the sparse method.

# Using the sparse method reproduces the exact ground state energy while the optimization time is

#
# In conclusion, we have leaned that building quantum chemistry circuits adaptively and using the
# functionality for sparse objects makes molecular simulations significantly efficient. In this
# tutorial, we followed an adaptive strategy that selects a group of gates at each time. This method
# can be extended such that the gates are selected one at time [#grimsley2019]_. You can implement
# the second method yourself and compare the results with the one we obtained above.

The key component of variational quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry is the circuit used to
prepare electronic ground states of a molecule. The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)
[#peruzzo2014]_, [#yudong2019]_ is the method of choice for performing such quantum chemistry
simulations on quantum devices with few qubits. For a given molecule, the appropriate circuit can
be generated by using a pre-selected wavefunction ansatz, for example, the unitary coupled cluster
with single and double excitations (UCCSD) [#romero2017]_. In this approach, we include all
possible single and double excitations of electrons from the occupied spin-orbitals of a reference
state to the unoccupied spin-orbitals [#givenstutorial]_. This makes the construction of the ansatz
straightforward for any given molecule. However, using a pre-constructed ansatz has the disadvantage
of reducing performance in favour of generality: the approach may work well in many cases, but it
will not be optimized for a specific problem.

In practical applications, including all possible excitations usually increases the cost of the
simulations without improving the accuracy of the results. This motivates implementing a strategy
that allows for approximation of the contribution of the excitations and selects only those
excitations that are found to be important for the given molecule. This can be done by using
adaptive methods to construct a circuit for each given problem [#grimsley2019]_. Using adaptive
circuits helps improve performance at the cost of reducing generality.

    Examples of selecting specific gates to generate adaptive circuits.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to **adaptively** build customized quantum chemistry circuits
to perform ADAPT-VQE [#grimsley2019]_ simulations. This includes a recipe to adaptively select gates
that have a significant contribution to the desired state, while neglecting those that have a small
contribution. You will also learn how to use PennyLane to leverage the sparsity of a molecular
Hamiltonian to make the computation of the expectation values even more efficient. Let's get
started!

Adaptive circuits
-----------------

The main idea behind building adaptive circuits is to compute the gradients with respect to all
possible excitation gates and then select gates based on the magnitude of the computed gradients.

There are different ways to make use of the gradient information and here we discuss one of
these strategies and apply it to compute the ground state energy of LiH. This method requires constructing the
Hamiltonian and determining all possible excitations, which we can do with functionality built into PennyLane.
But we first need to define the molecular parameters, including atomic symbols and coordinates.
Note that the atomic coordinates are in `Bohr <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_radius>`_.

# as triple and quadruple excitations can be considered as well. Each of these electronic excitations
# is represented by a gate that excites electrons from the occupied orbitals of a reference state to
# the unoccupied ones. This allows us to prepare a state that is a superposition of the reference

#
# Adaptive Optimizer
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# The adaptive optimizer
# grows an input quantum circuit by adding and optimizing gates selected from a user-defined
# collection of operators. The algorithm first appends all of the gates provided in the initial
# operator pool and computes the circuit gradients with respect to the gate parameters. It retains
# the gate which has the largest gradient and then optimizes its parameter.
# The process of growing the circuit can be repeated until the computed gradients converge to zero.
# Let's use :class:`~.pennylane.AdaptiveOptimizer` to perform an ADAPT-VQE [#grimsley2019]_
# simulation and build an adaptive circuit for LiH.

# We first create the operator pool which contains all single and double excitations.

# orders of magnitude depending on the size of the molecule. We use the selected gates obtained in

#
# Conclusions
# -----------
# We have learned that building quantum chemistry circuits adaptively and using the
# functionality for sparse objects makes molecular simulations significantly more efficient. We
# learned how to use an adaptive optimizer implemented in PennyLane, that selects the gates one at
# time, to perform ADAPT-VQE [#grimsley2019]_ simulations. We also followed an adaptive strategy
# that selects a group of gates based on information about the gradients.

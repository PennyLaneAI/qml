Introduction
-------------------------------------

Quantum circuits with a large number of qubits are difficult to simulate.
They cannot be programmed on actual hardware due to size constraints
(insufficient qubits), and they are also error-prone. What if we "cut"
a large circuit into smaller, more manageable pieces? This is the main
idea behind the algorithm that allows you to simulate large quantum
circuits on a small quantum computer called *quantum circuit cutting*.

In this demo, we will first introduce the theory behind quantum circuit
cutting based on Pauli measurements and see how it is implemented in
PennyLane. This method was first introduced in [#Peng2019]_.
Thereafter, we discuss the theoretical basis on randomized circuit
cutting with two-designs and demonstrate the resulting improvement in
performance compared to Pauli measurement-based circuit cutting for an
instance of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).



Background: Understanding the Pauli cutting method
--------------------------------------------------

Consider a two-level quantum system in an arbitrary state, described by
density matrix :math:`\rho`. The quantum state :math:`\rho` can be expressed
as a linear combination of the Pauli matrices:

.. math::
    \rho = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{8} c_i Tr(\rho O_i)\rho_i.

Here, we have denoted Pauli matrices by :math:`O_i`, their
eigenprojectors by :math:`\rho_i` and their corresponding eigenvalues by
:math:`c_i`. In the above equation,

.. math::
    O_1 = O_2 = I,
.. math::
    O_3 = O_4 = X,
.. math::
    O_5 = O_6 = Y

and

.. math::
    O_7 = O_8 = Z.

Also,

.. math::
    \rho_1 = \rho_7=\left | {0} \right\rangle \left\langle {0} \right |,
.. math::
    \rho_2 = \rho_8 = \left | {1} \right\rangle \left\langle {1} \right |,
.. math::
    \rho_3 = \left | {+} \right\rangle \left\langle {+} \right |,
.. math::
    \rho_4 = \left | {-} \right\rangle \left\langle {-} \right |,
.. math::
    \rho_5 = \left | {+i} \right\rangle \left\langle {+i} \right |,
.. math::
    \rho_6 = \left | {-i} \right\rangle \left\langle {-i} \right |

and

.. math::
    c_i = \pm 1.

The above equation can be implemented as a quantum circuit on a quantum
computer. To do this, each term :math:`Tr(\rho O_i)\rho_i` in the equation
is broken into two parts. The first part, :math:`Tr(\rho O_i)` is the
expectation of the observable :math:`O_i` when the system is in the state
:math:`\rho`. Let's call this first circuit subcircuit-:math:`u`.
The second part, :math:`\rho_i` is initialization or preparation of the
eigenstate, :math:`\rho_i`. Let's call this Second circuit subcircuit-:math:`v`.
The above equation shows how we can recover a quantum state after a cut is made
on one of its qubits as shown in figure 1. This forms the core of quantum
circuit cutting.

It turns out that we only have to do three measurements
:math:`\left (Tr(\rho X), Tr(\rho Y), Tr(\rho Z) \right)` for
subcircuit-:math:`u` and initialize subcircuit-:math:`v` with only four
states: :math:`\left | {0} \right\rangle`,
:math:`\left | {1} \right\rangle`, :math:`\left | {+} \right\rangle` and
:math:`\left | {+i} \right\rangle`. The other two nontrivial expectation
values for states :math:`\left | {-} \right\rangle` and
:math:`\left | {- i} \right\rangle` can be derived with classical
post-processing.

In general, there is a resolution of the identity along a wire (qubit) that
we can interpret as circuit cutting. In the following section, we will
provide a more clever way of resolving the same identity that leads
to fewer shots needed to estimate observables.

PennyLane implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PennyLane's built-in  circuit cutting algorithm, ``qml.cut_circuit``,
takes a large quantum circuit and decomposes it into smaller subcircuits that
are executed on a small quantum device. The results from executing the
smaller subcircuits are then recombined through some classical post-processing
to obtain the original result of the large quantum circuit.

Let’s simulate a "real-world" scenario with ``qml.cut_circuit`` using the
circuit below.

#
# Apart from ensuring that the number of qubits for each subcircuit does not
# exceed the number of qubits on our quantum device, we also have to ensure
# that the resulting subcircuits have the most efficient classical
# post-processing. This is not quite trivial to determine in most cases, but
# for the above circuit, the best cut location turns out to be between
# the two ``CZ`` gates on qubit 1 (more on this later). Hence, we place a

# Let's explore what happens behind the scenes in  ``qml.cut_circuit``. When the
# ``circuit`` qnode function is executed, the quantum circuit is converted to
# a `quantum tape <https://pennylane.ai/blog/2021/08/how-to-write-quantum-function-transforms-in-pennylane/>`__
# and then to a graph. Any ``WireCut`` in the quantum
# circuit graph is replaced with ``MeasureNode`` and ``PrepareNode`` pairs as
# shown in figure 2. The ``MeasureNode`` is the point on the cut qubit that
# indicates where to measure the observable :math:`O_i` after cut. On the other
# hand, the ``PrepareNode`` is the point on the cut qubit that indicates where
# to initialize the state :math:`\rho` after cut.
# Both ``MeasureNode`` and ``PrepareNode`` are placeholder
# operations that allow us to cut the quantum circuit graph and then iterate
# over measurements of Pauli observables and preparations of their corresponding
# eigenstate configurations at cut locations.

# Cutting at the said location gives two graph fragments with 2 qubits each. To
# separate these fragments into different subcircuit graphs, the
# ``fragment_graph()`` function is called to pull apart the quantum circuit
# graph as shown in figure 3. The subcircuit graphs are reconverted back to
# quantum tapes and ``qml.cut_circuit`` runs multiple configurations of the
# 2-qubit subcircuit tapes which are then post-processed to replicate the result
# of the uncut circuit.

# **Automatic cut placement**
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#


######################################################################
# We manually found a good cut position, but what if we didn't know where it
# was in general? Changing cut positions results in different outcomes in terms
# of simulation efficiency, so choosing the optimal cut reduces post-processing
# overhead and improves simulation efficiency.
#
# Automatic cut placment is a PennyLane functionality that aids us in
# finding the optimal cut that fragments a circuit such that
# the classical post-processing overhead is minimized. The main algorithm
# behind automatic cut placement is `graph partitioning <https://kahypar.org/>`__
#
# If ``auto_cutter`` is enabled in ``qml.cut_circuit``, PennyLane makes attempts
# to find an optimal cut using graph partitioning. Whenever it is difficult to
# manually determine the optimal cut location, this is the recommended
# approach to circuit cutting. The following example shows this capability
# on the same circuit as above but with the ``WireCut`` removed.

# Randomized Circuit Cutting
# ------------------------------------
#
# After reviewing the standard circuit cutting based on Pauli measurements
# on single qubits, we are now ready to discuss an improved circuit
# cutting protocol that uses randomized measurements to speed up circuit
# cutting. Our description of this method will be based on the recently
# published work [#Lowe2022]_.
#
# The key idea behind this approach is to use measurements in an entangled
# basis that is based on a unitary 2-design to get more information about
# the state with fewer measurements compared to single-qubit Pauli
# measurements.
#
# The concept of 2-designs is simple — a unitary 2-design is a finite
# collection of unitaries such that the average of any degree 2 polynomial
# function of a linear operator over the design is exactly the same as the
# average over Haar random measure. For further explanation of this measure read
# the `Haar Measure demo <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_haar_measure.html>`__.
#
# More precisely, let :math:`P(U)` be a polynomial with homogeneous degree at most two in
# the entries of a unitary matrix :math:`U`, and degree two in the complex
# conjugates of those entries. A unitary 2-design is a set of :math:`L`
# unitaries :math:`\{U_{L}\}` such that
#
# .. math:: \frac{1}{L} \sum_{l=1}^{L} P(U_l) = \int_{\mathcal{U}(d)} P (U) d\mu(U)~.
#
# The elements of the Clifford group over the qubits being cut are an
# example of a 2-design. We don’t have a lot of space here to go into too
# many details. But fear not - there is an `entire
# demo <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_unitary_designs.html>`__
# dedicated to this wonderful topic!

#     :align: center
#     :width: 90%
#
#     Figure 4. Illustration of Randomized Circuit Cutting based on Two-Designs. Taken from [#Lowe2022]_.
#
# If :math:`k` qubits are being cut, then the dimensionality of the
# Hilbert space is :math:`d=2^{k}`. The key idea of Randomized Circuit Cutting
# is to employ two different quantum channels with probabilities such that together
# they comprise a resolution of Identity. In the randomized measurement circuit
# cutting procedure, we trace out the :math:`k` qubits and prepare a random basis
# state with probability :math:`d/(2d+1)`. For a linear operator
# :math:`X \in \mathbf{L}(\mathbb{C}^{d})` acting on the :math:`k` qubits,
# this operation corresponds to the completely depolarizing channel
#
# .. math::  \Psi_{1}(X) = \textrm{Tr}(X)\frac{\mathbf{1}}{d}~.
#
# Otherwise, we perform a measure-and-prepare protocol based on
# a unitary 2-design (e.g. a random Clifford) with probability
# :math:`(d+1)/(2d+1)`, corresponding to the channel
#
# .. math::  \Psi_{0}(X) = \frac{1}{d+1}\left(\textrm{Tr}(X)\mathbf{1} + X\right)~.
#
# The sets of Kraus operators for the channels :math:`\Psi_{1} and \Psi_{0}` are
#
# .. math::
#
#   \Psi_{1}(X) \xrightarrow{} \left\{ \frac{|i\rangle \langle j|}{\sqrt{d}} \right\} \quad
#   \Psi_{0}(X) \xrightarrow{} \left\{ \frac{\mathbf{1}}{\sqrt{d+1}} ~,~ \frac{|i\rangle \langle j|}{\sqrt{d+1}} \right\}~,
#
# where indices :math:`i,j` run over the :math:`d` basis elements.
#
# Together, these two channels can be used to obtain a resolution of the
# Identity channel on the :math:`k`-qubits as follows
#
# .. math::   X = (d+1)\Psi_0(X)-d\Psi_1(X)~.
#
# By employing this procedure, we can estimate the outcome of the original
# circuit by using the cut circuits. For an error threshold of
# :math:`\varepsilon`, the associated overhead is
# :math:`O(4^{k}(n+k^{2})/\varepsilon^{2})`. When :math:`k` is a small
# constant and the circuit is cut into roughly two equal halves, this
# procedure effectively doubles the number of qubits that can be
# simulated given a quantum device, since the overhead is :math:`O(4^k)`
# which is much lower than the :math:`O(16^k)` overhead of cutting with single-qubit
# measurements. Note that, although the overhead incurred is smaller, the
# average depth of the circuit is greater since a random Clifford unitary
# over the :math:`k` qubits has to be implemented when randomized measurement
# is performed.
#
# Comparison
# ---------------------
#
# We have seen that looking at circuit cutting through the lens of
# 2-designs can be a source of considerable speedups. A good test case
# where one may care about accurately estimating an observable is the
# `Quantum Approximate Optimization
# Algorithm <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qaoa_intro.html>`__
# (QAOA). In its simplest form, QAOA concerns itself with finding a
# lowest energy state of a *cost Hamiltonian* :math:`H_{\mathcal{C}}`:
#
# .. math::   H_\mathcal{C} = \frac{1}{|E|} \sum _{(i, j) \in E} Z_i Z_j
#
# on a graph :math:`G=(V,E)`, where :math:`Z_i` is a Pauli-:math:`Z`
# operator. The normalization factor is just here so that expectation
# values do not lie outside the :math:`[-1,1]` interval.
#
# Setup
# ~~~~~
#
# Suppose that we have a specific class of graphs we care about and
# someone already provided us with optimal angles :math:`\gamma` and
# :math:`\beta` for QAOA of depth :math:`p=1`. Here’s how to map the input
# graph :math:`G` to the QAOA circuit that solves our problem:

# The randomized channel-based cutting method
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# As noted earlier, the easiest way to mathematically represent the
# randomized channel-based method is to write down Kraus operators for the
# relevant channels, :math:`\Psi _0` and :math:`\Psi _1`. Once we have
# represented them in explicit matrix form, we can simply use ``qml.QubitChannel``.
#
#
# To get our matrices, we represent the computational basis set along the
# :math:`k` cut wires as a unit vector
#
# .. math::
#
#   \left\vert i \right\rangle \mapsto (0, \ldots, 1,\ldots,0)
#
# with the 1 positioned at index :math:`i`. Therefore:
#
# .. math::
#
#    \left\vert i \right\rangle \left\langle j \right\vert \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}
#        0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
#        0 & \ddots & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
#        \vdots & 0 & 1 & 0 & \vdots \\
#        0 & 0 & \cdots & \ddots & 0 \\
#        0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
#    \end{pmatrix}
#
# where the 1 sits at column :math:`i` and row :math:`j`.
#
# Given this representation, a neat way to get all Kraus operators’ matrix
# representations is the following:
#


def make_kraus_ops(num_wires: int):

    d = 2**num_wires

    # High level idea: Take the identity operator on d^2 x d^2 and look at each row independently.
    # When reshaped into a matrix, it gives exactly the matrix representation of |i><j|:

    kraus0 = np.identity(d**2).reshape(d**2, d, d)

    kraus0 = np.concatenate([kraus0, np.identity(d)[None, :, :]], axis=0)
    # Add the identity op' to the mix

    kraus0 /= np.sqrt(d + 1)  # Normalize

    # Same trick for the other Kraus op'
    kraus1 = np.identity(d**2).reshape(d**2, d, d)
    kraus1 /= np.sqrt(d)

    # Finally, return a list of NumPy arrays, as per `qml.QubitChannel` docs.
    return list(kraus0.astype(complex)), list(kraus1.astype(complex))


######################################################################
# Our next task is to generate two new ``QuantumTape`` objects from our
# existing ``tape``, one for :math:`\Psi _0` and one for :math:`\Psi _1`.
# Currently, a ``qml.WireCut`` dummy gate is used to represent the cut
# position and size. So, iterating through gates in ``tape``:
#
# -  If the gate is a ``qml.WireCut``, we apply the ``qml.QubitChannel``
#    corresponding to :math:`\Psi _0` or :math:`\Psi _1` to different new
#    tapes.
# -  Otherwise, just apply the same existing gate to both new tapes.
#

#

# You may have noticed that both generated tapes have the same size as
# the original ``tape``. It may seem that no circuit cutting actually took
# place. However, this is just an artifact of the way we chose to
# represent **classical communication** between subcircuits.
# Measure-and-prepare channels at work here are more naturally implemented
# on a mixed-state simulator. On a real quantum device, however,
# introducing a classical communication step is equivalent to separating
# the circuit into two.
#
# Given that we are dealing with quantum channels, we need a mixed-state
# simulator. Luckily, PennyLane has just what we need:
#

# We only need a single run for each of the two generated tapes, ``tape0`` and

#

samples = np.zeros((n_shots, len(tape.wires)), dtype=int)

# We see that the randomized method converges faster than the Pauli method
# - fewer shots will get us a better estimate of the true cost function.
# This is even more apparent when we increase the number of shots and go
# to larger graphs and/or QAOA depths :math:`p`. For example, here are
# some results that include cost variances as well as mean values for a
# varying number of shots.

#     Figure 6. An example of QAOA cost convergence for a circuit cut both
#     with the Pauli method and randomized channel method.
#
# The randomized method offers a quadratic overhead reduction. In
# practice, for larger cuts, we see that it offers a performance that is orders of magnitude
# better than that of the Pauli method. For larger circuits, even at
# :math:`10^6` shots, Pauli estimates still sometimes leave the allowed
# interval of :math:`[-1,1]`.
#
# However, these improvements come at the cost of increased circuit depth
# due to inserting random Clifford gates and additional classical
# communication required.
#
# Multiple cuts and mid-circuit measurements
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Careful readers may have noticed that QAOA at depth :math:`p=1` has a
# specific structure of a `Matrix Product
# State <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_tn_circuits.html>`__
# (MPS) circuit. However, in order to cut a :math:`p=2` QAOA circuit, we
# would need 2 cuts. This introduces some subtleties within the context of
# classical simulation that we point out here.
#
# The measurement performed as a part of the first cut always induces a
# reduced state on the remaining wires. If the circuit has an MPS
# structure, we can just measure all qubits at once —a part of the
# measured bitstring gets passed into the second fragment and the
# remaining bits go directly into the output bitstring. However, when we
# try the same thing on a non-MPS circuit, additional gates need to be
# applied on the wires that now hold a reduced state. This is the other
# reason why it is easier to simulate circuit cutting of a non-MPS circuit
# with a mixed-state simulator.
#

#     Figure 7. A schematic representation of the mid-circuit measurement
#     “problem”.
#
# Note that, in these cases, memory requirements of classical simulation
# are increased from :math:`O(2^n)` to :math:`O(4^n)`. However, this is
# only a constraint for classical simulation where we have to choose
# between state-vector and density-matrix approaches. Real quantum
# devices don’t have such limitations, of course.

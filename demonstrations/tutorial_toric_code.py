*Author: PennyLane dev team. Posted: xx April 2022*


The `toric code model <https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9707021>`__ is a treasure trove of interesting physics and
mathematics. The model sparked the development of the error-correcting `surface codes <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.0928.pdf>`__ , an essential category of error correction models. But why is the
model so useful for error correction?

To answer that question, we need to delve into mathematics and condensed matter physics. Viewing the model as a description of spins in a really exotic magnet allows us to start analyzing the model as a material. What kind of material is it? The toric code is an example of a topological state of matter.

A state of matter, or phase, cannot become a different phase without some kind of discontinuity in the physical properties as coefficients in the Hamiltonian change. For example, ice cannot become water without a discontinuity in density as the temperature changes. The ground state of a **topological** state of matter cannot be smoothly deformed to a non-entangled state without a phase transition. Entanglement, and more critically *long-range* entanglement, is a key hallmark of a topological state of matter.

This exotic phase cannot be detected by local measurements but can only be measured across the entire system. To better consider this type of property, consider the parity of the number of dancers on a dance floor. Does everyone have a partner, or is there an odd person out? To measure that, we have to look at the entire system.

Topology is the study of global properties that are preserved under continuous deformations. For example, a coffee cup is equivalent to a donut because they both have a single hole. More technically, they both have an `Euler characteristic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic>`__ of zero. When we zoom to a local patch, both a sphere and a torus look the same. Only by considering the object as a whole can you detect the single hole.

In this demo, we will be looking at the degenerate ground state and the
excitations of the toric code model. The toric code was initialized
proposed in “Fault-tolerant quantum computation by anyons” by Kitaev,
and this demo was inspired by “Realizing topologically ordered states on
a quantum processor” by K. J. Satzinger et al. For further reading, I
recommend “Quantum Spin Liquids” by Lucile Savary and Leon Balents. (add
links and proper citations and stuff)

The Model
---------

What is the source of all this interesting physics? The Hamiltonian is:

.. math::
   \mathcal{H} = -\sum_s S_s - \sum_p P_p

.. math::
   S_s = \prod_{i \in s} Z_i \quad P_p = \prod_{j \in p} X_j

In the literature, the :math:`S_s` terms are called the “star”
operators, and the :math:`P_p` terms are called the “plaquette”
operators. Each star :math:`s` and plaquette :math:`p` is a group of 4 sites. In the most common formulation of the model, sites live on
the edges of a square lattice. The “plaquette” operators are products of Pauli X operators on all the sites
in a square, and the "star" operators are products of Pauli Z operators on all the sites bordering a vertex.

The model can also be viewed as a checkerboard of alternating square
types. Each square is a group of four sites, and adjacent squares
alternate between the two types of groups. Since the groups on
this checkerboard no longer look like stars and plaquettes, we will call
them the “Z Group” and “X Group” operators in this tutorial.

.. figure:: ../demonstrations/toric_code/stars_plaquettes2.png
    :align: center
    :width: 70%

We will be embedding the lattice on a torus via periodic boundary
conditions. Periodic boundary conditions basically “glue” the bottom of
the lattice to the top of the lattice and the left to the right.

This matching is done with modular arithemetic. Any site at ``(x,y)`` is
the same as a site at ``(x+width, y+height)``.

.. figure:: ../demonstrations/toric_code/converting_to_torus.png
    :align: center
    :width: 70%

On to some practical coding!

We will be storing our lattice sites as a tuple of x and y coordinates.
We will be using this tuples as wires labels, but we will have to be
careful so that PennyLane does not interpret the site as two wire
labels, but instead a single wire label. Whenever passing a single site,
be careful to wrap it within a object of length 1, like ``[s]`` instead
of passing ``(x,y)`` as a wire label by itself.

# The ground state
# ================
# 
# While individual X and Z operators do not commute with each other, the X Group and Z Group operators
# do:
#
# .. math::
#
#      [S_s, P_p] = 0.
#
# Since they commute, the wavefunction can be an eigenstate of each group operator individually. To minimize
# the energy of the Hamiltonian on the system as a whole, we can just minimize the contribution of each group operator.
# Due to the negative coefficients in the Hamiltonian, to minimize the contribution of a term, we need to maximize the
# eigenvalue an individual operator.  The maximum eigenvalue for each operator is simply one.
#
# .. math::
#
#       S_s |G \rangle = +1 |G \rangle \qquad \qquad P_p | G \rangle = +1 |G\rangle.
# 
# Now we just have to find a wavefunction that obeys these constraints. 
# 
# .. math::
# 
#    | G \rangle =  \prod_{p} \frac{\mathbb{I} + P_p}{\sqrt{2}} |00\dots 0\rangle = \prod_{p} U_p |00\dots 0 \rangle
# 
# where :math:`p` (plaquette) denotes the X Groups. We won’t prove that is
# the ground state here, we are merely going to use it as is.
# 
# Once we know how the operator that applies on a single group, we can
# tile that decomposition. To better understand this formula, let’s write
# it concretely for a single group of four qubits:
# 
# .. math::
# 
# 
#    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\mathbb{I} + X_1 X_2 X_3 X_4 \right) |0000 \rangle
#    = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |0000\rangle + |1111\rangle \right)
# 
# This generalized GHZ state can be prepared with a Hadamard and 3 CNOT
# gates:
# 
# .. figure:: ../demonstrations/toric_code/generalized_ghz_draw.png
#     :align: center
#     :width: 50%
#
# This decomposition for :math:`U_p` holds only when the initial Hadamard
# qubit begins in the :math:`|0\rangle` state, so we need to be careful in
# choosing which qubit to apply the initial Hadamard gate to. This is the
# reason why we rotated the order for a single X Group on the right border
# earlier.
# 
# We will also not need to prepare the final X Group that contains the
# four edges of the lattice, as it will already be prepared by preparation
# of the surrounding groups.
# 
# The paper “Realizing topologically ordered states on a quantum
# processor” that inspired this demo used a special order of operations to
# prepare the ground state to accomdate the constraints of the Sycamore
# processor. We don’t have the same contraints on a simulator, so we chose
# a more straightforward ordering.

# Now let’s actually put these together into a circuit!

# Excitations
# -----------
#
# Quasiparticles allow physicists to describe complex
# systems as interacting particles in a vacuum. Common examples of
# quasiparticles include electrons and holes in semiconductors, phonons,
# and magnons.
#
# Imagine trying to describe the traffic on a road. We could either:
#
# -  explicitly enumerate the location of each vehicle
# -  describe the locations and severities of traffic jam
#
# The first option provides the complete information about the system but
# is much more difficult to work with. For most purposes, we can just work
# with information about how the traffic deviates from a baseline. In
# semiconductors, we don’t write out the wavefunction for every single
# electron. We instead use electrons and holes. Neither quasiparticle
# electrons or holes are fundamental particles like an electron or
# positron in a vacuum. Instead, they are useful descriptions of how the
# wavefunction differs from its ground state.
#
# While the electrons and holes of a metal behave just like electrons and
# positrons in a vacuum, some condensed matter systems contain
# quasiparticles that cannot or do not exist as fundamental particles.
#
# 
# .. math::
# 
# 
#    | \phi \rangle = X_i | G \rangle.
# 
# Since the Z Group operator contains a Z operator at the same location as
# the X operator, the two components anti-commute:
# 
# .. math::
# 
# 
#    S_s X_i = \left( Z_i Z_a Z_b Z_c \right) X_i = - X_i S_s
# 
# Using this relation, we can determine the eigenvalue of the group
# operator on the pertubed state.
# 
# .. math::
# 
# 
#    S_s |\phi\rangle = S_s X_i |G\rangle = - X_i S_s |G\rangle = - X_i |G\rangle = - |\phi\rangle
# 
# This analysis repeats for the effect of a Z operator on the X Group
# eigenvalue.
# 
# Since each site borders on two X Groups and two Z Groups, applying a
# single pertubation will flip the signs of two group operators.
# 
# Each site with a flipped eigenvalue is considered an excitation. In the
# literature, you will often see a Z Group excitation
# :math:`\langle S_s \rangle = -1` called an “electric” e excitation and
# an X Group excitation :math:`\langle P_p \rangle = -1` called a
# “magnetic” m excitation. You may also see inclusion of an identity
# :math:`\mathbb{I}` particle for the ground state and the combination
# particle :math:`\Psi` consisting of a single e and a single m
# excitation.

# Mutual Exchange Statistics
# --------------------------
#
# The hole in the center of the donut isn’t the only thing that prevents
# paths from smoothly deforming into each other. We don’t yet know if we
# can deform paths past other particles.
#
# # When one indistinguishable fermion of spin 1/2 orbits another fermion of
# the same type, the combined wavefunction picks up a factor of negative
# one. When fermions of different types orbit each other, the state is
# unchanged. For example, if an electron goes around a proton and comes
# back to the same spot, the wavefunction is unchanged. If a boson orbits
# around a different type of boson, again the wavefunction is unchanged.
#
# What if a particle went around a different type of particle and
# everything picked up a phase? Would it be a boson or a fermion?
#
# It would be something else entirely: an anyon. An anyon is anything that
# doesn’t cleanly fall into the boson+fermion categorization of particles.
#
# While the toric code itself is just an extremely useful mathematical
# model, anyons actually exist in real materials. For example, the
# fractional quantum Hall systems has anyonic particles with spin
# :math:`1/q` for different integers :math:`q`.
# What happens we apply a Pauli operator to the ground state? Let’s start
# by considering what happens to an Z Group eigenvalue when we apply a X
# operator on one of the sites that it contains:

# Hadamard test
# -------------
# 
# The Hadamard test extracts the real component of a unitary operation
# :math:`\text{Re}\left(\langle \psi | U \rangle \right)`.
# 
# 1. The auxiliary qubit is prepared into a superposition with a Hadamard
#    gate
# 2. A controlled version of the operation is performed with the auxiliary
#    qubit as the control
# 3. Another Hadamard is applied to the auxiliary qubit
# 4. The auxiliary qubit is measured
# 
# .. figure:: ../demonstrations/toric_code/Hadamard_test.png
#     :align: center
#     :width: 50%
#
# Since the unitary in this case is the application of a phase to a state,
# :math:`e^{i \phi}`, the real component is :math:`\cos (\phi)`.
# 
# Bonus challenge: Show that the Hadamard tests gives the correct
# expectation value using pen and paper.

# In this demo, we have demonstrated:
# 
# 1. How to prepare the ground state of the toric code model on a lattice
#    of qubits
# 2. How to create and move excitations
# 3. The ground state degeneracy of the model on a toric lattice, arising
#    from homotopically distinct loops of operations
# 4. The excitations are anyons due to non-trivial mutual statistics

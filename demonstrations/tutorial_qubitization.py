r"""Intro to Qubitization
=========================

Qubitization is a Block Encodinig technique with very particular properties. This operator opens up a range of
applications such as Qubitization-based QPE that are not possible with other encoding techniques.
In this demo we will introduce this operator, and we will code it in PennyLane via :class:`~.pennylane.Qubitization`.


Block Encoding
----------------

A standard approach to encode this Hamiltonian is **Block Encoding**,
which embeds the Hamiltonian inside the matrix representing the circuit:

.. math::
    \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\mathcal{H}}{\lambda} & \cdot \\ \cdot & \cdot \end{bmatrix},

where :math:`\lambda` is a known normalization factor.
The most popular technique is :math:`\text{Prep}^{\dagger}\text{Sel}\text{Prep}`, which you can learn more about in `this demo <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_lcu_blockencoding/>`_.
This encoding creates an operator :math:`\text{BE}_\mathcal{H}` such that, applied to an eigenvector
of :math:`\mathcal{H}`, generates the state:

.. math::
    \text{BE}_\mathcal{H}|0\rangle \otimes |\phi_k\rangle = \frac{E_k}{\lambda}|0\rangle \otimes|\phi_k\rangle + \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{E_k}{\lambda}\right)^2} |\psi^{\perp}\rangle,

where :math:`|\psi^{\perp}\rangle` is a state orthogonal to :math:`|0\rangle \otimes |\phi_k\rangle`
and :math:`E_k` is the eigenvalue.
This allows us to represent the initial state in a two-dimensional space  â€” idea that we have exploited in our `Amplitude Amplification <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_intro_amplitude_amplification/>`_ demo:

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/qubitization/qubitization_lcu.jpeg
    :align: center
    :width: 60%
    :target: javascript:void(0)

    Representation of the state which forms an angle of :math:`\theta = \arccos {\frac{E_k}{\lambda}}` with the x-axis.



Qubitization Operator
----------------------

Any Block Encoding technique, manages to transform the state :math:`|0\rangle \otimes |\phi_k\rangle` into state :math:`\text{BE}_\mathcal{H}|0\rangle \otimes |\phi_k\rangle`. But the way to do it is not unique.
Working in the above subspace, there are two ways to do it, through a reflection or through a rotation.

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/qubitization/block_encodings.jpeg
    :align: center
    :width: 80%
    :target: javascript:void(0)

The :math:`\text{Prep}^{\dagger}\text{Sel}\text{Prep}` subroutine is the reflection Block Encoding and Qubitization is the rotation Block Encoding.
This simple difference will play a key role in the choice of technique for particular algorithms.
In order to find the construction of this rotation, we will follow the same idea of Amplitude Amplification:
two reflections are equivalent to one rotation.

The first reflection is made with respect to the x-axis, which, for our initial state :math:`|0\rangle \otimes |\phi_k\rangle`, has no effect, and
the second reflection is the :math:`\text{Prep}^{\dagger}\text{Sel}\text{Prep}` reflection:

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/qubitization/reflections_qubitization.jpeg
    :align: center
    :width: 100%
    :target: javascript:void(0)

From this we can deduce the expression of the Qubitization operator:

.. math::

    Q = \text{Prep}^{\dagger}\text{Sel}\text{Prep}(2|0\rangle \langle 0| - \mathbb{I}),

Where the reflection on zero is applied only in the first register of the state.










The two eigenstates of this rotation are :math:`\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|0\rangle|\phi_k\rangle \pm \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}|\psi^{\perp}\rangle`
and, in general, they are not trivial to prepare. This is where the second major observation of the algorithm is born:
the :math:`|0\rangle|\phi_k\rangle` state is the uniform superposition of the two eigenstates. Therefore,
applying QPE to that state, we obtain the two eigenvalues superposition,
from which we extract :math:`\theta`.

    :align: center
    :width: 60%
    :target: javascript:void(0)


Qubitization in PennyLane
--------------------------

The great advantage of doing a rotation Block Encoding, is that it encodes the rotation angle in its eigenvalues and
this can be used to calculate the eigenvalues of :math:`\mathcal{H}`.
Therefore, we will use Quantum Phase Estimation to obtain these values. In `this demo <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qpe/>`_  you can learn more about
how QPE works.

In PennyLane, Qubitization operator can be built by making use of :class:`~.pennylane.Qubitization`. We just have to pass the
Hamiltonian and the control qubits characteristic of the Block Encoding.

.. note::
    The number of control qubits should be :math:`âŒˆ\log_2 kâŒ‰` where :math:`k` is the number of terms in the Hamiltonian.

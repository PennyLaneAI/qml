r"""Intro to Qubitization
=========================

Encoding a Hamiltonian :math:`\mathcal{H}` into a quantum computer is a fundamental task for many applications, but the way to do it is not unique.
One method that is gaining special recognition is known as **Qubitization**. In this demo we will introduce this operator,
and we will code one of its more important applications in PennyLane via the :class:`~.pennylane.Qubitization` template.

Qubitization operator
----------------------

Going directly to the point, the Qubitization operator is defined as:

.. math::

    Q =  \text{Prep}_{\mathcal{H}}^{\dagger} \text{Sel}_{\mathcal{H}} \text{Prep}_{\mathcal{H}}\cdot (2|0\rangle\langle 0| - I),

where :math:`\text{Prep}_{\mathcal{H}}` and :math:`\text{Sel}_{\mathcal{H}}` are the preparation and selection operators
used on `this demo <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_lcu_blockencoding/>`_.
:math:`Q` is a block encoding operator with a key property: its eigenvalues encode the Hamiltonian eigenvalues.


In particular, if :math:`E` is an eigenvalue of :math:`\mathcal{H}`, then :math:`e^{i\arccos(E/\lambda)}` is an
eigenvalue of :math:`Q`, where :math:`\lambda` is a known normalization factor. This property is used in the context
of Quantum Phase Estimation to approximate the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian.

Sounds good but, where this decomposition come from? Why the eigenvalues are encoded in this way? ðŸ¤”

Below, we will show you how to reach these conclusions in a simple way!

Block Encoding
----------------

Firstly, we introduce some useful concepts of Block Encoding.
Given a Hamiltonian :math:`\mathcal{H}`, we can define as Block Encoding **any operator** which embeds :math:`\mathcal{H}`
inside the matrix associated to the circuit:

.. math::
    \text{Block Encoding}_\mathcal{H} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} \mathcal{H} / \lambda & \cdot \\ \cdot & \cdot \end{bmatrix}.

Given an :math:`\mathcal{H}` eigenvector such that :math:`\mathcal{H}| \phi \rangle = E | \phi \rangle`, we can deduce that any :math:`\text{Block Encoding}_\mathcal{H}`
generates a state:

.. math::
    |\Psi\rangle = \frac{E}{\lambda}|0\rangle |\phi\rangle + \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{E}{\lambda}\right)^2} |\phi^{\perp}\rangle,

where :math:`|\phi^{\perp}\rangle` is a state orthogonal to :math:`|0\rangle |\phi\rangle`,
and :math:`E` is the eigenvalue. The advantage of expressing :math:`|\Psi\rangle` as the sum of two orthogonal states is that it can be represented
in a two-dimensional space  â€” idea that we have exploited in our `Amplitude Amplification <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_intro_amplitude_amplification/>`_ demo.

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/qubitization/qubitization0.jpeg
    :align: center
    :width: 50%
    :target: javascript:void(0)

    Representation of the state which forms an angle of :math:`\theta = \arccos {\frac{E}{\lambda}}` with the x-axis.

Qubitization as a rotation
---------------------------

Any Block Encoding operator, manages to transform the state :math:`|0\rangle |\phi\rangle` into the state :math:`|\Psi\rangle`.
The Qubitization operator does this by just applying a :math:`\theta` rotation in that subspace.
The advantage of rotations is that they encode the rotation angle in their eigenvalues as :math:`e^{\pm i\theta}`
and we can use algorithms such as QPE to obtain this information.

Since :math:`\theta = \arccos {\frac{E}{\lambda}}`, we can rewrite the eigenvalues
of :math:`Q` as :math:`e^{\pm i\arccos {\frac{E}{\lambda}}}`.

In order to build this rotation we will follow the same idea of Amplitude Amplification:
two reflections are equivalent to one rotation.

Let's use for instance :math:`|\Psi\rangle` as an initial state to visualize the rotation.
The first reflection we make is with respect to the x-axis:

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/qubitization/qubitization2.jpeg
    :align: center
    :width: 50%
    :target: javascript:void(0)

This is built by making a reflection on the state :math:`|0\rangle` restricted to the first register:

.. math::

    R_{|0\rangle} = 2|0\rangle\langle 0| - I.

The second reflection of interest will be over the bisector of :math:`|\Psi\rangle`
and the x-axis:

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/qubitization/qubitization3.jpeg
    :align: center
    :width: 60%
    :target: javascript:void(0)

As we can see, this reflection achieves a rotation of :math:`\theta` degrees with respect to the initial state.
But how are we supposed to find this particular reflection? Fortunately, we don't have to look very far: the block encoding :math:`\text{Prep}_{\mathcal{H}}^{\dagger} \text{Sel}_{\mathcal{H}} \text{Prep}_{\mathcal{H}}` ,or just :math:`\text{PSP}_{\mathcal{H}}`, is
exactly that reflection ðŸ¤¯. To learn more about this technique, take a look to `this demo <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_lcu_blockencoding/>`_.


To prove that this is the reflection we are looking for, firstly we have to check that :math:`\text{PSP}_{\mathcal{H}}^2 = \mathbb{I}`,
definition of a reflection. This property is fulfilled by the construction of the operator.
After that, we can know the reflection axis, by taking the midpoint between an input state and
its output. Using :math:`|0\rangle|\phi\rangle` as input and knowing that :math:`|\Psi\rangle` is the output,
we note that the reflection is indeed over that bisector.

The union of these two reflections defines our :math:`\theta` rotation in the subspace.


Qubitization in PennyLane
--------------------------

Now that we know how to encode the Hamiltonian in this useful way, let's see how we can use Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)
to retrieve the encoded eigenvalue. In `this demo <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qpe/>`_  you can learn more about
how QPE works. The algorithm is expressed in the following way:

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/qubitization/QPE_qubitization.png
    :align: center
    :width: 50%
    :target: javascript:void(0)

Applying QPE with the Qubitization operator (i.e., the :math:`\theta` rotation in subspace), we will get the :math:`\theta` and :math:`-\theta` values.

Let's define the Hamiltonian to see an example:

"""

import pennylane as qml

H = -0.4 * qml.Z(0) + 0.3 * qml.Z(1) + 0.4 * qml.Z(0) @ qml.Z(1)

print(qml.matrix(H))

# We have chosen a diagonal matrix since it is easy to identify eigenvalues and eigenvectors but it
# would work with any Hamiltonian. We are going to take :math:`|\phi\rangle = |11\rangle` and we will try to
# estimate its eigenvalue :math:`E = 0.5` using this technique.
#
# In PennyLane, the Qubitization operator can be built by making use of :class:`~.pennylane.Qubitization`. We just have to pass the
# Hamiltonian and the control qubits characteristic of the Block Encoding, where the number of control wires
# is :math:`âŒˆ\log_2 kâŒ‰` where :math:`k` is the number of terms in the Hamiltonian LCU representation.
#
# .. note::
#
#    Qubitization rotation in pennylane is clockwise defined as the adjunct of the operator described above.
#
#

control_wires = [2, 3]
estimation_wires = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

dev = qml.device("default.qubit")

@qml.qnode(dev)
def circuit():
    # Initialize the eigenstate |11âŸ©
    for wire in [0, 1]:
        qml.X(wire)

    # Apply QPE with the Qubitization operator
    qml.QuantumPhaseEstimation(qml.Qubitization(H, control_wires), estimation_wires = estimation_wires)

    return qml.probs(wires=estimation_wires)

##############################################################################
# Let's run the circuit and plot the estimated :math:`\theta` values:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('pennylane.drawer.plot')

results = circuit()

bit_strings = [f"0.{x:0{len(estimation_wires)}b}" for x in range(len(results))]

plt.bar(bit_strings, results)
plt.xlabel("theta")
plt.ylabel("probability")
plt.xticks(range(0, len(results), 3),
           bit_strings[::3],
           rotation="vertical")

plt.subplots_adjust(bottom=0.3)
plt.show()

##############################################################################
# The two peaks obtained refer to values of :math:`|\theta\rangle` and :math:`|-\theta\rangle`.
# Finally, by doing some post-processing, we can obtain the value of :math:`E`:

import numpy as np

lambda_ = sum([abs(coeff) for coeff in H.terms()[0]])

# Simplification by estimating theta with the peak value
print("E = ", lambda_ * np.cos(2 * np.pi * np.argmax(results) / 2** (len(estimation_wires))))

##############################################################################
# Great, we have managed to approximate the real value of :math:`E = 0.5`. ðŸš€

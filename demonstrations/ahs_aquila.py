*Author: Lillian M.A. Frederiksen — Posted: 16 May 2023.*

Neutral atom hardware is a new innovation in quantum technology that has been gaining traction in
recent years thanks to new developments in optical tweezer technology. One such device,
`QuEra's Aquila <https://www.quera.com/aquila>`__, is capable of running circuits with up to 256
physical qubits! The `Aquila device <https://aws.amazon.com/braket/quantum-computers/quera/>`__ is
now accessible and programmable via pulse programming in PennyLane and the
`PennyLane-Braket SDK plugin <https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin-python>`__.
In this demo, we will learn how to define a Hamiltonian for a driven Rydberg atom system in PennyLane,
and use it to first simulate a pulse program on Rydberg atoms, and then upload it and measure
the effect of Rydberg blockade on a hardware device!

Pulse programming basics in PennyLane
-------------------------------------

Pulse programming in PennyLane is a paradigm based on low-level control of electromagnetic driving
pulses. Pulse programs are written directly on the hardware level, skipping the abstraction of
decomposing algorithms into fixed native gate sets. While these abstractions are often used in proposed
error correction schemes to achieve fault tolerance in a universal quantum computer, in noisy and
intermediate-sized quantum computers, they can add unnecessary overhead (and thereby introduce
more noise).

In quantum computing architectures where qubits are realized through physical systems with discrete
energy levels, transitions from one state to another are driven by electromagnetic fields tuned to
be at or near the relevant energy gap. These electromagnetic fields can vary as a function of time.
The full system Hamiltonian is then a combination of the Hamiltonian describing the state of the
hardware when unperturbed, and a time-dependent drive.

Pulse control gives some insight into the low-level implementation of more abstract quantum
computations. In most digital quantum architectures, the
native gates of the computer are, at the implementation level, electromagnetic control pulses
that have been finely tuned to perform a particular logical gate.

This alternative approach requires a different type of control than what you might be used to in
PennyLane, where circuits are generally defined in terms of a series of gates. Specifically, pulse control
is implemented via the functionality provided in the Pennylane :mod:`~pennylane.pulse` module. For
more information on pulse programming in PennyLane, see the
`PennyLane docs <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/qml_pulse.html>`__, or check out the demo
about
`running a ctrl-VQE algorithm with pulse control <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_pulse_programming101.html>`__ on the PennyLane `default.qubit` simulator.



The QuEra Aquila device
-----------------------

The Aquila QPU works with programmable arrays of up to 256 Rubidium-87 atoms (Rb-87), trapped in vacuum by tightly
focused laser beams. These atoms can be arranged in (almost)
`arbitrary user-specified geometries <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_pasqal.html>`_ to determine
inter-qubit interactions. On the Aquila device, it is possible to specify 1D and 2D atom arrangements. Atom
positions may be slightly shifted to accommodate hardware limitations, and must obey lattice constraints
for spacing. This will be explored in more detail below.

Different energy levels of these atoms are used to encode qubits.

A primary application of pulse control in Rydberg atom systems like Aquila is the implementation of analog
Hamiltonian simulation. This is a technique that aims to investigate the behaviour of some
system of interest using a programmable, controllable device that emulates the target
system. For example, Rydberg atom systems have been used to probe the behaviour
of quantum spin liquids [#Semeghini]_ and antiferromagnetic Ising
models [#Lienhard]_.

Constructing a pulse program to run on the Aquila hardware is done in two steps, each of which allows us to modify
different parts of the system Hamiltonian:

1. Define atom positions, which determines qubit connectivity
2. Specify the quantum evolution via the drive parameters

Let's start with the atom positions and the resulting Hamiltonian term describing inter-qubit interactions.


Interaction term and atom arrangement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this treatment of the Hamiltonian, we will assume that we are operating such that we only allow
access to two states; the low and high energy states are referred to as the ground (:math:`| g \rangle`)
and Rydberg (:math:`| r \rangle`) states respectively.

Qubit interaction in a Rydberg atom system is mediated by a mechanism called Rydberg blockade, which arises
due to van der Waals forces between the atoms. This is described by the interaction Hamiltonian:

.. math:: \hat{H}_{int} = \sum_{j=1}^{N-1}\sum_{k=j+1}^{N} \frac{C_6}{R^6_{jk}}\hat{n}_j\hat{n}_k

where :math:`n_j=| r_j \rangle \langle r_j |` is the number operator acting on atom :math:`j`, :math:`R_{jk} = \lvert x_j - x_k \lvert` is the
distance between atoms :math:`j` and :math:`k`, and :math:`C_6` is a fixed value determined by the nature of the ground
and Rydberg states (for Aquila, :math:`5.24 \times 10^{-24} \text{rad m}^6 / \text{s}`, referring to the
:math:`| 70S_{1/2} \rangle` state of the Rb-87 atom).

There are two key things to be aware of in the interaction term. First, the energy contribution of
the interaction between each pair of atoms is only non-zero when both atoms are in the Rydberg state,
so that :math:`\langle \psi | \hat{n}_k \hat{n}_j | \psi \rangle  =1`. Second, the energy contribution for each
pair of atoms is inversely proportional to the distance between them. Thus, as we move two atoms closer
together, it becomes increasingly energetically expensive for both to be in the Rydberg state.

In the Aquila system, we define a *register* (the layout of the atoms) to modify these interactions.

Below is a conceptual diagram demonstrating this interaction for a pair of atoms. At a distance, a similar
energetic cost is paid to go from 0 to 1 excitation and from 1 to 2 excitations. However, as we move the
atoms into closer proximity, we see a rapidly increasing energy cost to drive to the doubly excited state.

    :figwidth: 55%
    :width: 95%
    :alt: A diagram of the energy levels for the ground, single excitation, and double excitation states

    Energy levels for the ground (:math:`| gg \rangle`), single Rydberg excitation (:math:`| gr \rangle`, :math:`| rg \rangle`),
    and double Rydberg excitation (:math:`| rr \rangle`) states

The modification of the energy levels when atoms are in proximity gives rise to Rydberg blockade,
where atoms that have been driven by a pulse that would, in isolation, leave them in the excited state
instead remain in the ground state due to neighboring atoms being excited. The distance within which two 
neighboring atoms are effectively prevented from both being excited is referred to as the *blockade radius* :math:`R_b`.

This brings us to our discussion of the second part of the Hamiltonian: the drive term.


The driven Rydberg Hamiltonian
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The atoms in a Rydberg system can be driven by application of a laser pulse, which can be described by 3 parameters:
amplitude (also called Rabi frequency) :math:`\Omega`, detuning :math:`\Delta`, and phase :math:`\phi`. While in
theory, a drive pulse can be applied to individual atoms, the current control setup for the Aquila hardware only
allows the application of a global drive pulse.

Let's look at how this plays out in the Hamiltonian describing a global drive targeting the ground
to Rydberg state transition. The driven Hamiltonian of the system is:

.. math::  \hat{H}_{drive} = \sum_{k=1}^N \frac{\Omega(t)}{2} (e^{i \phi(t)}| g_k \rangle \langle r_k | + e^{-i \phi(t)} | r_k \rangle \langle g_k |) - \Delta(t) \hat{n}_k

where :math:`| r \rangle` and :math:`| g \rangle` are the Rydberg and ground states.

Now that we know a bit about the system we will be manipulating, let us look at how to connect to a
real device.



Getting started with Amazon Braket
----------------------------------

For this demo, we will integrate PennyLane with Amazon Braket to perform measurements on Rydberg
atom based hardware provided by QuEra.

In PennyLane, Amazon Braket is accessed through the PennyLane-Braket plugin. The installation
instructions for the plugin can be found `here <https://amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`__.

The Pennylane-Braket plugin also comes pre-installed in the Braket managed notebooks
accessible through the `AWS console <https://aws.amazon.com/braket/>`__.

The remote hardware devices available on Amazon Braket can be found
`here <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-devices.html>`__, along with
information about each system, including which paradigm (gate-based, continuous variable or
analog Hamiltonian simulation) it operates under. Each device has a unique identifier known as an
ARN. In PennyLane, AHS-based Braket devices are accessed through a PennyLane device named
``braket.aws.ahs``, along with specification of the corresponding ARN.

.. note::

    To access remote services on Amazon Braket, you must first
    `create an account on AWS <https://aws.amazon.com/braket/getting-started/>`__ and also follow the
    `setup instructions <https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-sdk-python>`__ for accessing Braket from Python.

Connecting to Aquila
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you are set up with a Braket account, you can access the Aquila device. It is available online
in particular time windows, which can be found `here <https://www.quera.com/aquila>`__ , though you
can submit tasks to the queue at any time. Note that depending on queue lengths, there can be some
wait time to receive results even during the availability window of the device.

A simulated version on the Aquila hardware, ``braket.local.ahs``, is also available, and is an
excellent resource for testing out programs before committing to a particular hardware task. It
is important to be aware that some tasks that succeed in simulation will not be able to be sent
to hardware due to physical constraints of the measurement and control setup. Also,
be aware of the hardware specifications and capabilities when planning your pulse program. These
capabilities are accessible at any time from the hardware device; we will demonstrate in more
detail how to access these specifications as we go through this demo.

.. note::

    Those cells of this demo that contain the real device ``aquila`` will only run when hardware is online. If you want to run it at
    other times to experiment with the concepts, the hardware device can be switched out with the Braket
    AHS simulator. When interpreting the section of the demo regarding discretization for hardware, bear in
    mind that the simulator does not discretize the functions before upload, so it will not accurately
    demonstrate the discretization behaviour.


Let us access both the remote hardware device, and a local Rydberg atom simulator from AWS, and then
we can start defining our pulse program.

# Creating a Rydberg Hamiltonian

#
# Recall that placing atoms in close proximity creates a blockade effect, where it is energetically
# favourable for only one atom in each pair to be in the Rydberg state.

# Here we define a lattice of 3 atoms, all close enough together that we would expect only one of them
# to be excited at a time. We can see the hardware specifications for the atom lattice via:

# Simulating in PennyLane to find a pi-pulse
# ------------------------------------------
#
# A pi-pulse is any pulse calibrated to perform a 180 degree (:math:`\pi` radian) rotation on the
# Bloch Sphere that takes us from the ground state of the un-driven system to the excited state when
# applied. This corresponds to a :math:`\sigma_X = | g \rangle \langle r | + | r \rangle \langle g |` gate in the ground-rydberg basis on each qubit.
# Here we will create one, and observe the effect of applying it with the interaction term
# “turned off”. Ignoring the inter-qubit interactions for now allows us to calibrate a pi-pulse without
# worrying about the effect of Rydberg blockade.
#
# With the interaction term off, each qubit will evolve according to the unitary evolution
# :math:`U = \text{exp}\left(-i \frac{1}{2} \int d\tau \Omega(\tau) \sigma_X \right)` and we construct
# :math:`\Omega(t)` such that :math:`\int d\tau \frac{1}{2} \Omega(\tau) = \frac{\pi}{2}`,
# i.e. :math:`U = \exp(-i \frac{\pi}{2} \sigma_X) = -\sigma_X`.
#
# We will implement the pi-pulse using the drive term defined above, and tune the parameters of
# the gaussian envelope to implement the desired pulse.
#
# In the absence of the interaction term, each atom acts as a completely independent system, so
# we don't see any Rydberg blockade. Below, we’ve experimented with the parameters of
# the gaussian pulse envelope via trial-and-error to find settings that result in a pi-pulse:

# (determining the scale of the coefficient :math:`C_6/R_{jk}^6`). However, it is not determined by the interaction term
# alone-the blockade radius is also inversely proportional to how hard we drive the atoms. The blockade radius can be
# estimated as
#
# .. math:: R_b = (C_6/\sqrt{\Omega^2 + \Delta^2})^{1/6}
#
# Where :math:`\Omega` and :math:`\Delta` describe the amplitude and detuning of the drive, respectively.

#
# Let’s look at how we would move this simple pulse program from local simulations to hardware.
#
# Before uploading to hardware, it’s best to consider whether there are any constraints we need to be
# aware of. Only our amplitude parameter is non-zero, so let’s review the limitations we need to
# respect for defining an amplitude on hardware:
#
# -  All values must be within 0 to 2.51465 MHz
# -  The output will be linear between set-points, and the rate of change must never exceed 39788735 MHz/s
# -  The amplitude sequence must start and end at 0 MHz
#

times = np.linspace(0, 1.75, 36)
timestep = (times[1] - times[0]) * 1e-6  # Time step in seconds
amplitude = [gaussian_fn(amplitude_params, t) for t in times]

start_val = amplitude[0]
stop_val = amplitude[-1]
max_val = np.max(amplitude)
max_rate = np.max([(amplitude[i + 1] - amplitude[i]) / timestep for i in range(len(times)-1)])

print(f"start value: {start_val:.3} MHz")
print(f"stop value: {stop_val:.3} MHz")
print(f"maximum value: {max_val:.3} MHz")
print(f"maximum rate of change: {max_rate:.3} MHz/s")

#      start value: 0.00773 MHz
#      stop value: 0.0879 MHz
#      maximum value: 2.0 MHz
#      maximum rate of change: 4.01e+06 MHz/s
#
# Our maximum amplitude value and maximum rate of change are well below hardware limits, so the only
# constraint we need to enforce for our pulse program is ensuring the values at timestamps 0 and
# :math:`1.75 \, \mu s` are 0. For this, we can use a convenience function provided in the pulse module,
# :func:`~pennylane.pulse.rect`. We can wrap an existing function with it in order to apply a rectangular window
# within which the pulse has non-zero values.
#
# Note that the function is non-zero outside the window, and the window is defined as including the
# end-points. This means to ensure that 0 and 1.75 return 0, they need to be outside the interval
# defining the window; we’ll use ``windows=[0.01, 1.749]``. Our modified global drive is then:
#

amp_fn = qml.pulse.rect(gaussian_fn, windows=[0.01, 1.749])
global_drive = qml.pulse.rydberg_drive(amplitude=amp_fn,
                                       phase=0,
                                       detuning=0,
                                       wires=[0, 1, 2])

# At this point we could skip directly to defining a ``qnode`` using the ``aquila`` device and running our
# pulse program. However, before we do, let’s take a look at how the parameters
# we’ve used to define our pulse program will be converted into hardware upload data. It can be useful
# to examine this to ensure your pulse program looks as you expect it to before paying for a hardware run.
#
# To do this, we create the operator we will be using in our circuit, and pass it to a method on the
# hardware device that creates an AHS program for upload:
#
op = qml.evolve(H_interaction + global_drive)(params, ts)
ahs_program = aquila.create_ahs_program(op)

######################################################################
# On a hardware device, the ``create_ahs_program`` method will modify both the register and the pulses
# before upload (this method is called internally when a circuit is run on the ``aquila`` device).
# Float variables are rounded to specific, valid set points, producing a discretized
# version of the input (for example, atom locations in the register lock into grid points). For this
# pulse, we’re interested in the amplitude and the register.
#
# For the register, recall that we defined our coordinates in micrometres as
# ``[(0, 0), (5, 0), (2.5, 4.330127018922194)]``, and that we expect the hardware upload program to be
# in SI units, i.e. micrometres have been converted to metres. We can access the
# ``ahs_program.register.coordinate_list`` to see the :math:`x` and :math:`y` coordinates that will be passed to
# the hardware, and plot them against the coordinates in the register we defined for the Hamiltonian:
#

ahs_x_coordinates = ahs_program.register.coordinate_list(0)
ahs_y_coordinates = ahs_program.register.coordinate_list(1)

op_register = op.H.settings.register
op_x_coordinates = [x * 1e-6 for x, _ in op_register]
op_y_coordinates = [y * 1e-6 for _, y in op_register]

plt.scatter(ahs_x_coordinates, ahs_y_coordinates, label="AHS program")
plt.scatter(op_x_coordinates, op_y_coordinates, marker="x", label="Input register")

# We observe the same pattern on the hardware that we can see in simulation—a single
# excitation amongst the three atoms within the blockade distance of one another.
# On hardware, it is possible to scale models beyond what is feasible to simulate;
# while simulation can't handle large numbers of qubits, the Aquila QPU can be initialized
# with up to 256 qubits!
#
#
#
#
# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# Rydberg atom systems are an interesting and developing field within quantum computing. It is now
# possible to connect to the Aquila QPU via PennyLane and Amazon Braket, and perform measurements on hardware
# with up to 256 qubits. Programs for the Aquila hardware can be defined using PennyLane's
# :mod:`~pennylane.pulse` module, allowing users to define time-dependent control of pulse parameters.
#
# Interfacing with the Aquila hardware provides an opportunity to take a small model of a concept that
# has been tested in simulation, and scale it up to run on up to 256 qubits on hardware. Manipulating
# Rydberg atom systems through pulse-level control has applications in probing new areas of fundamental
# physics—like simulating quantum spin liquids at scales where it is not possible to classically
# simulate the quantum dynamics of the full experimental system!  [#Semeghini]_ [#Asthana2022]_
#
# Here, we have demonstrated a simple, amplitude-only pulse implementing the quintessential behaviour
# of Rydberg atom systems: Rydberg blockade. Introducing phase and detuning to create a more complex
# drive Hamiltonian, and arranging atoms to create specific configurations of inter-atom interaction,
# allows more intricate systems to be studied.

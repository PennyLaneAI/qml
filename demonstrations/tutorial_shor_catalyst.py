# The past few years stimulated a lot of discussion about *hybrid
# quantum-classical algorithms*. For a time, this terminology was synonymous
# with *variational algorithms*. However, integration with classical
# co-processors is necessary for every quantum algorithm, even ones considered
# quintessentially quantum. 
#
# Shor's famous factoring algorith [CITE] is one such example. Have a look at the
# example code below:

import jax.numpy as jnp

def shors_algorithm(N):
    p, q = 0, 0

    while p * q != N:
        a = jnp.random.choice(jnp.arange(2, N - 1))

        if jnp.gcd(N, a) != 1:
            p = jnp.gcd(N, a)
            return p, N // p

        guess_r = guess_order(N, a)

        if guess_r % 2 == 0:
            guess_square_root = (a ** (guess_r // 2)) % N

            # Ensure the guessed solution is non-trivial
            if guess_square_root not in [1, N - 1]:
                p = jnp.gcd(N, guess_square_root - 1)
                q = jnp.gcd(N, guess_square_root + 1)

    return p, q

# If you saw this code out-of-context, would you even realize this is a quantum
# algorithm? There are no quantum circuits in sight!
#
# As quantum hardware continues to scale up, the way we think about quantum
# programming is evolving in tandem. Writing circuits gate-by-gate for
# algorithms with hundreds or thousands of qubits is unsustainable. Morever, a
# programmer doesn't actually need to know anything quantum is happening, if the
# software library can generate and compile appropriate quantum code (though,
# they should probably have at least some awareness, since the output of
# ``guess_order`` is probabilistic!).  This raises some questions: what gets
# compiled, where and how does compilation happen, and what do we gain?
#
# Over the past year, PennyLane has become increasingly integrated with
# `Catalyst
# <https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/catalyst/en/latest/index.html>`_, which
# for just-in-time compilation of classical and quantum code together. In this
# demo, we will leverage this to develop an implementation of Shor's factoring
# algorithm that is just-in-time compiled from end-to-end, classical control
# structure and all. In particular, we will see how to leverage Catalyst's
# mid-circuit measurement capabilities to reduce the size of quantum circuits,
# and how JIT compilation enables faster execution overall.
#
# Crash course on Shor's algorithm
# --------------------------------
#
# Looking back at the code above, we can see that Shor's algorithm is broken
# down into a couple distinct steps. Suppose we wish to decompose an integer
# :math:`N` into its two constituent prime factors, :math:`p` and :math:`q`.
#
#  - First, we randomly select a candidate integer, :math:`a`, between 2 and
#    :math:`N-1` (before proceeding, we double check that we did not get lucky and randomly select one of the true factors)
#  - Using our chosen a, we proceed to the quantum part of the algorithm: order-finding.
#    Quantum circuits are generated, and the circuit is executed on a device. The results
#    are used to make a guess for a non-trivial square root.
#  - If the square root is non-trivial, we test whether we found the factors. Otherwise, we try again
#    with more shots. Eventually, we try with a different value of a.
#    
# For a full description of Shor's algorithm, the interested reader is referred
# to the relevant module in the `PennyLane Codebook
# <https://pennylane.ai/codebook/10-shors-algorithm/>`_. What's important here
# for us is to note that for each new value of :math:`a` (and more generally,
# each possible :math:`N`), we must compile and optimize many large quantum
# circuits, each of which consists of many nested subroutines.
#
# In both classical and quantum programming, compilation is the process of
# translating operations expressed in high-level languages down to the language
# of the hardware. As depicted below, it involves multiple passes over the code,
# through one or more intermediate representations, and both machine-independent and
# dependent optimizations.

#    :alt: The quantum compilation stack.
#
#    High-level overview of the quantum compilation stack and its constituent
#    parts. Each step contains numerous subroutines and passes of its own, and
#    many require solving computationally hard problems (or very good heuristic
#    techniques).
#
# Developing automated compilation tools is a very active and important area of
# research, and is a major requirement for today's software stacks. Even if a
# library contains many functions for pre-written quantum circuits, without a
# proper compiler a user would be left to optimize and map them to hardware by hand.
# This is an extremely laborious (and error-prone!) process, and furthermore,
# is unlikely to be optimal.
#
# However, our implementation of Shor's algorithm surfaces another complication.
# Even if we have a good compiler, every random choice of ``a`` yields a
# different quantum circuit (as we will discuss in the implementation details
# below). Each of these circuits, generated independently at runtime, would need
# to be compiled and optimized, leading to a huge overhead in computation
# time. One could potentially generate, optimize, and store circuits and
# subroutines for reuse. But note that they depend on both ``a`` and ``N``,
# where in a cryptographic context, ``N`` relates to a public key which is
# unique for every entity. Morever, for sizes of cryptographic relevance, ``N``
# will be a 2048-bit integer or larger!
#
# The previous discussion also neglects the fact that the quantum computation
# happens within the context of an algorithm that includes classical code and
# control flow. In Shor's algorithm, this is fairly minimal, but one can imagine
# larger workflows with substantial classical subroutines that themselves must
# be compiled and optimized, perhaps even in tandem with the quantum code. This
# is where Catalyst and quantum just-in-time compilation come into play.
#
#
# JIT compiling classical and quantum code
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# In *compiled* languages, like C and C++, compilation is a process that happens
# offline prior to executing your code. An input program is sent to a compiler,
# which outputs a new program in assembly code. An assembler then turns this
# into a machine-executable program which you can run and feed inputs
# to. [#PurpleDragonBook]_.
#
# On the other hand, in *interpreted* languages (like Python), both the source
# program and inputs are fed to the intepreter, which processes them line
# by line, and directly gives us the program output.
# 
# Compiled and interpreted languages, and languages within each category, all
# have unique strengths and weakness. Compilation will generally lead to faster
# execution, but can be harder to debug than interpretation, where execution can
# halt partway and provide direct diagnostic information about where something
# went wrong [#PurpleDragonBook]_. *Just-in-time compilation* offers a solution
# that lies, in some sense, at the boundary between the two.
#
# Just-in-time compilation involves compiling code *during* execution, for instance,
# while an interpreter is doing its job.

# The quantum part
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# In this section we'll describe the quantum circuits we use for the quantum
# part of Shor's algorithm, i.e., the order-finding routine. The presented
# implementation is based on that of [#Beauregard2003]_.
#
# Order finding is an application of *quantum phase estimation*. The operator
# whose phase is being estimated is :math:`U_a`, 
#
# ..math ::
#
#     U_a \vert x \rangle = \vert ax \pmod N \rangle
#
# where :math:`\vert x \rangle` is the basis state corresponding to the binary
# representation of the integer :math:`x`, and :math:`a` is the
# randomly-generated integer discussed above. The full circuit for QPE is shown
# below.
#
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/shor_catalyst/qpe_full.svg
#    :scale: 100%
#    :align: center
#    :alt: Quantum phase estimation circuit for order finding.
#
# This high-level view of the circuit hides a lot of the complexity,
# though. First and foremost, the actual implementation details of :math:`U_a`
# are not yet defined, and a significant number of auxiliary qubits are required
# for its implementation. There is also the issue of precision, which is
# governed by the number of estimation wires, :math:`t`. A better estimate will
# make finding a solution more likely. However, increasing :math:`t` adds
# overhead in circuit depth, and has the added simulation costs that come from
# increasing the size of the Hilbert space.
#
# In what follows, we will some shortcuts afforded by Catalyst. Specifically,
# with mid-circuit measurement and reset we can reduce the number of estimation
# wires to :math:`t=1`. A great deal of the arithmetic operations will be
# performed in the Fourier basis; and since we know :math:`a` in advance, we can
# vary circuit structure on the fly and save resources.  Finally, additional
# mid-circuit measurements can be used in lieu of uncomputation.
#
# Let's start by zooming in on the implementation of the controlled :math:`U_a`.

#    :scale: 100%
#    :align: center
#    :alt: Quantum phase estimation circuit for order finding.
#
# We require an equal-sized auxiliary register. The operation :math:`M_a` is multiplication
# modulo :math:`N`, which we will zoom in on below.

r"""Quantum Chebyshev Transform
=============================================================

Looking for ways to leverage the speed of the `quantum Fourier transform <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qft/>`__ is a common way to design quantum algorithms with exponential speed ups over classical algorithms. 
Working in the Fourier basis can be a more natural choice than the standard basis for some computations. 
Swapping bases is feasible due to the efficiency of the quantum Fourier transform.
In the paper `"Quantum Chebyshev transform: mapping, embedding, learning and sampling distributions" <https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17026>`__ [#williams2023]_, the authors describe a different basis, the *Chebyshev* basis, and its associated transformation, the *quantum Chebyshev transform*. 
They demonstrate the use of the Chebyshev basis space in generative modelling of probability distributions. 
Further work also proposes a protocol for learning and sampling multivariate probability distributions that arise in high-energy physics [#delejarza2025]_. 
Crucial to their implementation of the learning models is the quantum Chebyshev transform which utilizes the quantum Fourier transform to allow for fast transformations between the standard and the Chebyshev basis.

In this demo we will show how the quantum Chebyshev transform can be implemented in PennyLane. 
To start, we'll describe what Chebyshev polynomials are, and what the classical discrete Chebyshev transform is. After that, we'll look at the quantum Chebyshev basis and its transform.

What are Chebyshev polynomials?
---------------------------------------

`Chebyshev polynomials <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials>`__ of the first kind :math:`T_n(x)` are a set of orthogonal polynomials that are complete on the interval :math:`[-1,1]`. *Completeness* here means any function :math:`f(x)` on that interval can be expanded as a series in :math:`T_n(x)` up to order :math:`N` as :math:`f(x) = \sum_{j=0}^N a_j T_j(x)`.

The :math:`n` -th order Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind is defined as 

.. math::
  T_n(x) \equiv \cos(n \arccos(x))\,.

Note there are more types of Chebyshev polynomials, but in this demo, we will only discuss those of the first kind. We can write out the first few orders explicitly.

.. math::
  T_0(x) &= 1 \\
  T_1(x) &= x \\
  T_2(x) &= 2x^2-1 \\
  T_3(x) &= 4x^3 - 3x \\
  T_4(x) &= 8x^4 - 8x^2 + 1 \\
  &\ \,\vdots \\
  T_{n+1}(x) &= 2xT_n(x) - T_{n-1}(x)\,.

The recursion relation in the last line can be used to compute the next orders. 
Observe that odd and even order :math:`T_n` are odd and even functions, respectively. 
The roots of the :math:`T_n(x)` occur at the values 

.. math::
  x_n^\mathrm{Ch} = \cos\left(\frac{2k+1}{2n}\pi\right)\,, \quad k=0, ..., n-1\,. 

These are known as the `Chebyshev nodes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_nodes>`__.

    Figure 2. The first six Chebyshev polynomials, along with their corresponding nodes.

The nodes are plotted above along with the corresponding polynomials. 
Note that the polynomials are normalized such that $T_n(1)=1$, and they satisfy a discrete orthogonality condition on the nodes of :math:`T_N(x)` in the following way for :math:`k, \ell<N`

.. math::
  \sum^{N-1}_{j=0}T_k(x_j^\mathrm{Ch})T_\ell(x_j^\mathrm{Ch}) =  
    \begin{cases}
      0 & k \neq \ell\,,\\
      N & k = \ell = 0\,,\\
      N/2 & k = \ell \neq 0\,.
    \end{cases}

The Chebyshev polynomials have a lot of *nice* properties that make them a good choice to series expansion a function on a real interval. They are often utilized in numerical integration and interpolation methods, where the `discrete Chebyshev transformation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Chebyshev_transform>`__  is needed to map between the function evaluated on a grid of points and the coefficients of the Chebyshev expansion of that function. Let's take a look at the discrete transform.

Discrete Chebyshev transform
---------------------------------------
A common definition of the discrete Chebyshev transform uses the grid of Chebyshev nodes, also known as the roots grid, as the sampling points. For a given function :math:`f(x)` sampled at :math:`N` nodes on the interval :math:`[-1,1]`, the transform computes the coefficents of that function expanded in Chebyshev polynomials evaluated on the grid. That is, the :math:`j` -th coefficient, for :math:`j>0`, is

.. math::
    a_j = \frac{2}{N}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} f(x_k) T_j(x_k)\,,

and for :math:`j=0`, there is a slightly different normalization factor

.. math::
    a_0 = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} f(x_k)\,.

The inverse of the transform is then just the series expansion evaluated on the grid

.. math::
    f(x_k) = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} a_j T_j(x_k)\,.

Since a function expanded in Chebyshev polynomials in this way will be sampled on the non-uniformly spaced Chebyshev nodes, it will have more resolution at the boundary than in the middle. This can be beneficial if you are, for example, solving a differential equation and expect more interesting features at the boundary.

In general, computing the expansion of a function in a complete set on a classical computer for a discrete number of sampling points would take :math:`\mathcal{O}(N^2)` operations 🐌. 
However, because of the way the Chebyshev polynomials are defined in terms of cosine, the discrete Chebyshev transformation is related to the `discrete cosine transform <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform>`__. This allows the discrete Chebyshev transform to be implemented in a way that leverages the efficiency of the `fast-Fourier-transform <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform>`__-style algorithms for expansion, which take :math:`\mathcal{O}(N \log N)` operations 🚀. 

We can see the relation to the cosine transform by plugging in the definition of the Chebyshev polynomials and the nodes into the inverse transform and simplifying. Starting with the polynomials

.. math::
    f(x_k) = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} a_j \cos\left(j \cos^{-1}(x_k)\right)\,,

then, using the definition of the nodes we obtain 

.. math:: 
    f(x_k) = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} a_j \cos\left(\frac{j\pi}{N}(N + k + 1/2)\right)\,.

Finally, we can use the cyclical property of cosine to convert a :math:`j \pi` term in the argument to a :math:`(-1)^{j}` factor in the coefficient, resulting in

.. math:: 
    f(x_k) = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} a_j (-1)^{j}\cos\left(\frac{j\pi}{N}(k + 1/2)\right)\,,

which looks just like a discrete cosine transform.

The quantum analogue of the discrete Chebyshev transform, the quantum Chebyshev transform, inherits the relation to the Fourier transform, allowing the transform to be designed efficiently by utilizing the `quantum Fourier transform <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qft/>`__. Next we will discuss the quantum Chebyshev basis, where the Chebyshev polynomials appear in the state amplitudes.


Quantum Chebyshev basis
---------------------------------------
We can define the :math:`j` -th Chebyshev basis state using :math:`N` qubits as

.. math::
  |\tau(x_j^\mathrm{Ch})\rangle = \frac1{2^{N/2}}T_0(x_j^\mathrm{Ch})|0\rangle + \frac1{2^{(N-1)/2}}\sum_{k=1}^{2^N-1}T_k(x_j^\mathrm{Ch})|k\rangle\,,

where :math:`|k\rangle` are the computational basis states and :math:`x_j^\mathrm{Ch}` is the :math:`j` -th node of the Chebyshev polynomial of order :math:`2^N-1`. 
Notice how the amplitudes of the basis state components are the Chebyshev polynomials evaluated at the :math:`j` -th Chebyshev node, and that the normalization of the :math:`|0\rangle` component is different from the rest, like in the classical transform.
Due to the orthogonality of the Chebyshev polynomials and the normalization factors used, this construction guarantees the states are orthonormal, that is

.. math::
  \langle\tau(x_j^\mathrm{Ch})|\tau(x_{j'}^\mathrm{Ch})\rangle = 
    \begin{cases}
      0 & j \neq j'\,,\\
      1 & j = j'\,.
    \end{cases}

The quantum Chebyshev transform circuit described in Ref. [#williams2023]_ maps computational basis states :math:`\{|x_j\rangle\}_{j=0}^{2^N-1}` to Chebyshev basis states :math:`\{|\tau(x_j^\mathrm{Ch})\rangle\}_{j=0}^{2^N-1}`. Our goal is to design a circuit in PennyLane that applies the operation :math:`\mathcal{U}_\mathrm{QChT} = \sum_{j=0}^{2^N-1} |\tau(x_j^\mathrm{Ch})\rangle\langle x_j|`.


Designing the transform circuit
---------------------------------------
Let's start from the end and look at the circuit diagram generated from the code we want to write. 
An auxiliary qubit is required, which will be the :math:`0` indexed qubit, and the rest compose the state :math:`|x\rangle` which starts in the computational basis, shown below as :math:`|\psi\rangle`. We demonstrate for :math:`N=4` non-auxiliary qubits.

    Figure 3. Quantum Chebyshev transform circuit. 

The intuition for the structure of the above circuit comes from the link between the discrete Chebyshev transform and the discrete cosine transform. 
Notice the use of the `quantum Fourier transform (QFT) <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qft/>`__ applied on all qubits. 
The quantum Chebyshev transform is an extended QFT circuit with some added interference and mixing of the elements. 
Note the auxiliary qubit starts and ends in the state :math:`|0\rangle`, and the amplitudes of the transformed state are all real valued.
Let's break down the circuit above into pieces that we will use inside our circuit function. 

First, a Hadamard gate is applied to the auxiliary qubit, and then a CNOT ladder is applied, controlled on the auxiliary qubit. 
To start, we will define a function for the CNOT ladder.

# Conclusion
# ----------
# In this tutorial, we've gone through how to implement the quantum Chebyshev transform from the paper by Williams *et al.*, and tested the circuit output by looking at the state amplitudes and the orthonormality. 
# The properties of Chebyshev polynomials and the speed at which the quantum Chebyshev transform can be implemented make the Chebyshev basis an interesting choice of state space for quantum algorithms, such as generative modelling of probability distributions.
# To build a generative model in the Chebyshev basis, one could implement the quantum Chebyshev feature map from the same paper [#williams2023]_, which prepares a state in the Chevyshev space via a parameter :math:`x``.

*Author: Maria Schuld — Posted: 11 October 2019. Last updated: 11 December 2023.*

In this tutorial, we show how to use PennyLane to implement variational
quantum classifiers - quantum circuits that can be trained from labelled
data to classify new data samples. The two examples used are inspired by two of the first papers that 
proposed variational circuits as supervised machine learning models:
`Farhi and Neven (2018) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06002>`__ as well as
`Schuld et al. (2018) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00633>`__.

#
# More precisely, the first example shows that a variational circuit can be optimized to 
# emulate the parity function
#
# .. math::
#
#     f: x \in \{0,1\}^{\otimes n} \rightarrow y =
#     \begin{cases} 1 \text{  if uneven number of 1's in } x \\ 0
#     \text{ else}. \end{cases}
#
# It demonstrates how to encode binary inputs into
# the initial state of the variational circuit, which is simply a
# computational basis state (*basis encoding*).
#
# The second example shows how to encode real vectors as amplitude vectors into quantum states (*amplitude
# encoding*) and how to train a variational circuit to recognize the first two classes of
# flowers in the Iris dataset.
#
# 1. Fitting the parity function
# ------------------------------
#
# Imports
# ~~~~~~~
#
# We start by importing PennyLane, the PennyLane-provided version of NumPy,
# and an optimizer.

import pennylane as qml
from pennylane import numpy as np
from pennylane.optimize import NesterovMomentumOptimizer

##############################################################################
# Quantum and classical nodes
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# We then create a quantum device that will run our circuits.

dev = qml.device("default.qubit")

##############################################################################
# Variational classifiers usually define a “layer” or “block”, which is an
# elementary circuit architecture that gets repeated to build the
# full variational circuit.
#
# Our circuit layer will use four qubits, or wires, and consists of an arbitrary
# rotation on every qubit, as well as a ring of CNOTs that entangles each qubit
# with its neighbour. Borrowing from machine learning, we call the parameters
# of the layer ``weights``.


def layer(layer_weights):
    for wire in range(4):
        qml.Rot(*layer_weights[wire], wires=wire)

    for wires in ([0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 0]):
        qml.CNOT(wires)


##############################################################################
# We also need a way to encode data inputs :math:`x` into the circuit, so
# that the measured output depends on the inputs. In this first example,
# the inputs are bitstrings, which we encode into the state of the qubits.
# The quantum state :math:`\psi` after
# state preparation is a computational basis state that has 1s where
# :math:`x` has 1s, for example
#
# .. math::  x = 0101 \rightarrow |\psi \rangle = |0101 \rangle .
#
# The :class:`~pennylane.BasisState` function provided by PennyLane is made to do just
# this. It expects ``x`` to be a list of zeros and ones, i.e. ``[0,1,0,1]``.


def state_preparation(x):
    qml.BasisState(x, wires=[0, 1, 2, 3])


##############################################################################
# Now we define the variational quantum circuit as this state preparation routine, followed
# by a repetition of the layer structure.


@qml.qnode(dev)
def circuit(weights, x):
    state_preparation(x)

    for layer_weights in weights:
        layer(layer_weights)

    return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))


##############################################################################
# If we want to add a “classical” bias parameter, the variational quantum
# classifier also needs some post-processing. We define the full model 
# as a sum of the output of the quantum circuit, plus the trainable bias.


def variational_classifier(weights, bias, x):
    return circuit(weights, x) + bias


##############################################################################
# Cost
# ~~~~
#
# In supervised learning, the cost function is usually the sum of a loss
# function and a regularizer. We restrict ourselves to the standard square loss that
# measures the distance between target labels and model predictions.


def square_loss(labels, predictions):
    # We use a call to qml.math.stack to allow subtracting the arrays directly
    return np.mean((labels - qml.math.stack(predictions)) ** 2)


##############################################################################
# To monitor how many inputs the current classifier predicted correctly,
# we also define the accuracy, or the proportion of predictions that agree with  
# a set of target labels.


def accuracy(labels, predictions):
    acc = sum(abs(l - p) < 1e-5 for l, p in zip(labels, predictions))
    acc = acc / len(labels)
    return acc


##############################################################################
# For learning tasks, the cost depends on the data - here the features and
# labels considered in the iteration of the optimization routine.


def cost(weights, bias, X, Y):
    predictions = [variational_classifier(weights, bias, x) for x in X]
    return square_loss(Y, predictions)

Y = Y * 2 - 1  # shift label from {0, 1} to {-1, 1}

for x,y in zip(X, Y):
    print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}")

# Next we create an optimizer instance and choose a batch size…

opt = NesterovMomentumOptimizer(0.5)
batch_size = 5

##############################################################################
# …and run the optimizer to train our model. We track the accuracy - the share of
# correctly classified data samples. For this we compute the outputs of the
# variational classifier and turn them into predictions in
# :math:`\{-1,1\}` by taking the sign of the output.

weights = weights_init

for it in range(100):

    # Update the weights by one optimizer step, using only a limited batch of data

# As we can see, the variational classifier learned to classify all bit strings from the training set 
# correctly. 
#
# But unlike optimization, in machine learning the goal is to generalize from limited 
# data to *unseen* examples. Even if the variational quantum circuit 
# was perfectly optimized with respect to the cost, it might not generalize, a phenomenon 
# known as *overfitting*. 
# The art of (quantum) machine learning is to create models and learning procedures 
# that tend to find "good" minima, or those that lead to models which generalize well.
#
# With this in mind, let's look at a test set of examples we have not used during training: 

data = np.loadtxt("variational_classifier/data/parity_test.txt", dtype=int)
X_test = np.array(data[:, :-1])
Y_test = np.array(data[:, -1])
Y_test = Y_test * 2 - 1  # shift label from {0, 1} to {-1, 1}
    
predictions_test = [np.sign(variational_classifier(weights, bias, x)) for x in X_test]

for x,y,p in zip(X_test, Y_test, predictions_test):
    print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}, pred={p}")
    
acc_test = accuracy(Y_test, predictions_test)
print("Accuracy on unseen data:", acc_test)

##############################################################################
# The quantum circuit has also learnt to predict all unseen examples perfectly well! 
# This is actually remarkable, since the encoding strategy creates quantum states 
# from the data that have zero overlap -- and hence the states created from the test 
# set have no overlap with the states created from the training set. There are 
# many functional relations the variational circuit could learn from this kind 
# of representation, but the classifier chooses to label bit strings according 
# to our ground truth, the parity function.
#
# Let's look at the second example, in which we use another encoding strategy.
#
# 2. Iris classification
# ----------------------
#
# We now move on to classifying data points from the Iris dataset, which are no longer
# simple bitstrings but represented as real-valued vectors. The vectors are 2-dimensional,
# but we will add some "latent dimensions" and therefore encode inputs into 2 qubits. 
#
# Quantum and classical nodes
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# State preparation is not as simple as when we represent a bitstring with
# a basis state. Every input x has to be translated into a set of angles
# which can get fed into a small routine for state preparation. To
# simplify things a bit, we will work with data from the positive
# subspace, so that we can ignore signs (which would require another
# cascade of rotations around the Z-axis).
#
# The circuit is coded according to the scheme in `Möttönen, et al.
# (2004) <https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407010>`__, or—as presented
# for positive vectors only—in `Schuld and Petruccione
# (2018) <https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-96424-9>`__. We
# also decomposed controlled Y-axis rotations into more basic
# gates, following `Nielsen and Chuang
# (2010) <http://www.michaelnielsen.org/qcqi/>`__.

# Data
# ~~~~
#
# We load the Iris data set. There is a bit of preprocessing to do in
# order to encode the inputs into the amplitudes of a quantum state. We will augment the
# data points by two so-called "latent dimensions", making the size of the padded data point
# match the size of the state vector in the quantum device. We then need
# to normalize the data points, and finally, we translate the inputs x to rotation
# angles using the ``get_angles`` function we defined above.
#
# Data preprocessing should always be done with the problem in mind; for example, if we do not 
# add any latent dimensions, normalization erases any information on the length of the vectors and 
# classes separated by this feature will not be distinguishable.

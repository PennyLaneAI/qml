Barren Plateaus
---------------

:doc:`Barren plateaus </demos/tutorial_barren_plateaus>` are large regions of the cost function's parameter space
where the variance of the gradient is almost 0; or, put another way, the
cost function landscape is flat. This means that a variational circuit
initialized in one of these areas will be untrainable using any gradient-based
algorithm.



In `"Cost-Function-Dependent Barren Plateaus in Shallow Quantum Neural
Networks" <https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00550>`__ [#Cerezo2020]_, Cerezo et al. demonstrate the
idea that the barren plateau
phenomenon can, under some circumstances, be avoided by using cost functions that only have
information from part of the circuit. These *local* cost functions can be
more robust against noise, and may have better-behaved gradients with no
plateaus for shallow circuits.

   Taken from Cerezo et al. [#Cerezo2020]_.

Many variational quantum algorithms are constructed to use global cost functions.
Information from the entire measurement is used to analyze the result of the
circuit, and a cost function is calculated from this to quantify the circuit's
performance. A local cost function only considers information from a few qubits,
and attempts to analyze the behavior of the entire circuit from this limited scope.


Cerezo et al. also handily prove that these local cost functions are bounded by the
global ones, i.e., if a global cost function is formulated in the manner described
by Cerezo et al., then the value of its corresponding local cost function will always be
less than or equal to the value of the global cost function.

In this notebook, we investigate the effect of barren plateaus in
variational quantum algorithms, and how they can be mitigated using
local cost functions.


We first need to import the following modules.

# Visualizing the problem
# -----------------------
#
# To start, let's look at the task of learning the identity gate
# across multiple qubits. This will help us visualize the problem and get
# a sense of what is happening in the cost landscape.
#
# First we define a number of wires we want to train on. The work by
# Cerezo et al. shows that circuits are trainable under certain regimes, so
# how many qubits we train on will effect our results.

wires = 6
dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=wires, shots=10000)


######################################################################
# Next, we want to define our QNodes and our circuit ansatz. For this
# simple example, an ansatz that works well is simply a rotation along X,
# and a rotation along Y, repeated across all the qubits.
#
# We will also define our cost functions here. Since we are trying to
# learn the identity gate, a natural cost function is 1 minus the probability of measuring the
# zero state, denoted here as :math:`1 - p_{|0\rangle}`.
#
# .. math:: C = \langle  \psi(\theta) | \left(I - |0\rangle \langle 0|\right)  | \psi(\theta)  \rangle   =1-p_{|0\rangle}
#
# We will apply this across all qubits for our global cost function, i.e.,
#
# .. math:: C_{G} = \langle  \psi(\theta) | \left(I - |00 \ldots 0\rangle \langle 00 \ldots 0|\right) | \psi(\theta) \rangle  = 1-p_{|00 \ldots 0\rangle}
#
# and for the local cost function, we will sum the individual contributions from each qubit:
#
# .. math:: C_L = \langle \psi(\theta) | \left(I - \frac{1}{n} \sum_j |0\rangle \langle 0|_j\right)|\psi(\theta)\rangle = 1 - \sum_j p_{|0\rangle_j}.
#
# It might be clear to some readers now why this function can perform better.
# By formatting our local cost function in this way, we have essentially divided
# the problem up into multiple single-qubit terms, and summed all
# the results up.
#
# To implement this, we will define a separate QNode for the local cost
# function and the global cost function.

# But, how often does this problem occur? If we wanted to train this
# circuit from a random starting point, how often would we be stuck in a
# plateau? To investigate this, let's attempt to train the global cost
# function using random starting positions and count how many times we run
# into a barren plateau.
#
# Let's use a number of qubits we are more likely to use in a real variational
# circuit: n=10. We will say that after
# 400 steps, any run with a cost function of less than 0.9 (chosen
# arbitrarily) will probably be trainable given more time. Any run with a
# greater cost function will probably be in a plateau.

# In the global case, anywhere between 70-80% of starting positions are

# ansatz—and the number of qubits—increases, this factor will increase.
#
# We can compare that to our local cost function, where every single area trained,
# and most even trained in less time. While these examples are simple,
# this local-vs-global cost behaviour has been shown to extend to more

# This demo is based on the paper ‘A Comparative Analysis of Adversarial Robustness for Quantum and
# Classical Machine Learning Models’ [#Wendlinger]_ by M.Wendlinger, K.Tscharke and P.Debus, which dives into the
# world of adversarial attacks on quantum computers to find relations to classical adversarial machine
# learning. In the following, we briefly cover the necessary theoretical baselines of adversarial
# attacks on classification networks before giving a hands-on example of how to construct such an
# attack and how we can make QML models more robust. Let’s go!

# What are adversarial attacks?
# -----------------------------
#
# Adversarial attacks are small, carefully crafted perturbations to input data that lead to high rates
# of misclassification for machine learning models, while the data seems to be identical to the
# original for human observers. In particular, images are sensitive to this type of attack, as small
# manipulations of the pixels can fool a classifier without any changes being visible to humans. A
# typical example of an adversarial attack is shown in the picture above, where an image of a panda is
# manipulated by adding a small noise to each pixel. The original image is correctly classified as
# “Panda” while the image with tiny manipulations is falsely classified as “Gibbon” (the noise is
# magnified in the figure so we can actually see it). This example is adapted from a famous paper [2]
# showing the vulnerability of classical machine learning models to adversarial attacks.
#
# Mathematically, the goal of an (untargeted) attack is to achieve a misclassification of the model
# such that a sample :math:`x` leads to a predicted label :math:`y' \neq y` that is not the true label
# :math:`y`. This is achieved by finding the perturbation :math:`\delta\in\Delta` to the original
# input that maximizes the loss of the true class. For a loss function :math:`\mathcal{L}`, a model
# :math:`f: \mathbb{R}^{D} \to \mathbb{R}^K` (mapping :math:`D`-dimensional input to softmax
# probability scores of :math:`K` classes with model parameters :math:`\theta^*`), the objective of
# the untargeted attack is: :raw-latex:`\begin{equation}
# \delta \equiv \; \underset{\delta^{\prime} \in \Delta}{\operatorname{argmax}} \;\mathcal{L}\left(f\left(x+\delta^{\prime} ; \theta^*\right), y\right)
# \end{equation}` Later, when we show how to actually construct such an attack, we will revisit this
# equation. For an adversarial attack to be considered useful, it must hold that the modifications to
# the input elements are imperceptible, i.e. that
# :math:`\Delta=\{\delta \in \mathbb{R}^{D}: \| \delta\|_{\infty} \le \varepsilon\}`, where
# :math:`\varepsilon` is some small bound, typically below :math:`0.1`.

# Why are adversarial attacks dangerous?
# --------------------------------------
#
# Machine learning is becoming essential in many security-critical applications, for example in
# cybersecurity, the medical sector, or autonomous vehicles. In cybersecurity, ML models are used,
# amongst others, for malware detection or the prevention of attacks on networks. Given their critical
# roles, any successful attack of these ML models can lead to severe consequences, ranging from
# financial losses and privacy violations to threats to human life. As we have seen above, adversarial
# attacks are imperceptible to humans, and hence difficult to detect. For this reason, it is essential
# that ML models in security-critical applications are robust against these types of attacks.
#
# Quantum machine learning has been shown to have theoretical advantages over classical ML methods [3]
# and is becoming increasingly popular. However, first works in this direction suggest that QML
# suffers from the same vulnerabilities as classical ML [4]. How the vulnerability of QML models
# relates to classical models and how robust the models are in comparison is evaluated in [1]. But
# enough talk, let’s see how we can actually attack a QML model!
#

######################################################################
# Let’s see this in action!
# -------------------------
#
# Setting up the environment
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# For this tutorial, we will use the Pennylane *TorchLayer* [5] class to perform circuit operations
# and optimizations with the PyTorch backend. Thus, we need to import the torch library alongside
# Pennylane:
#

import pennylane as qml
from pennylane import numpy as np
import torch
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

######################################################################
# Visualization of the dataset
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# As in the paper [1], we make use of the PlusMinus dataset, which serves as a good baseline for
# evaluating a QML image classification model’s ability to find useful features in the input. It also
# allows us to define the usefulness of attacks on the QML model while being low-dimensional enough to
# perform scalable training (more info on the dataset can be found in [1]). It consists of four
# classes of :math:`16\times16` pixel grayscale images which show one of the four symbols
# :math:`\{+,-,\vdash,\dashv\}`. Below we visualize one sample of each class to get an understanding
# of the dataset.
#
# The data can be loaded directly form the Pennylane Quantum datasets hub:
# https://pennylane.ai/datasets/ for easy integration into Pennylane circuits and optimization code.
#

# TODO use dataset hosted on pennylane, once available
# pm = qml.data.load('other, name='PlusMinus')

pm = qml.data.Dataset()
pm.read("./adversarial_attacks/data/PlusMinus.h5")

X_train = pm.img_train  # shape (1000,16,16)
X_test = pm.img_test  # shape (200,16,16)
Y_train = pm.labels_train  # shape (1000,)
Y_test = pm.labels_test  # shape (200,)

# show one image from each class (in the train- and testsets, the images are randomly permuted)
x_vis = [
    (X_train[Y_train == 0])[0],
    (X_train[Y_train == 1])[0],
    (X_train[Y_train == 2])[0],
    (X_train[Y_train == 3])[0],
]
y_vis = [0, 1, 2, 3]


# later when we train the model we include the predictions as well, so let's just add the functionality here
def visualize_data(x, y, pred=None):
    n_img = len(x)
    labels_list = ["\u2212", "\u002b", "\ua714", "\u02e7"]
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 4, figsize=(8, 2))
    for i in range(n_img):
        axes[i].imshow(x[i], cmap="gray")
        if pred is None:
            axes[i].set_title("Label: {}".format(labels_list[y[i]]))
        else:

# Building the QML circuit for classification
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# We will make use of a data-reuploading scheme to encode the 256 input pixels into the latent space
# of the quantum classifier. To this end, the *StronglyEntanglingLayers* [6] template provides an
# easy-to-use structure for the circuit design. The output of our classifier is a four-dimensional
# vector resulting from Pauli-Z oberservables along the first four qubits. These outputs (unnormalized
# probability scores - i.e. logits) are then used in the *CrossEntropyLoss* function to optimize the
# model parameters. Together with the PyTorch integration mentioned above, the classifier code looks
# like the following:

# Let’s break stuff!
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# As described before, the mathematical notation for an adversarial attack is as follows:
# :raw-latex:`\begin{equation}
# \delta \equiv \; \underset{\delta^{\prime} \in \Delta}{\operatorname{argmax}} \;\mathcal{L}\left(f\left(x+\delta^{\prime} ; \theta^*\right), y\right)
# \end{equation}` This equation can be summarized in a simple step-by-step recipe. In basic terms, we
# perform a forward and backward pass through the model and loss function (just like we do during
# training) for the specific samples that we want to find perturbations for. The difference to
# training steps is that the gradients we calculate are **with respect to the input features** of the
# data samples. Using these gradients, we find the direction of ascent in the loss function (as we
# want to force high losses, i.e. bad model performance for the specific samples). Finally, we clip
# the delta (perturbations), such that they lie within the epsilon boundary we set beforehand (this is
# just some hyperparameter wich limits the attack strength). All of these steps can be seen in the
# code below:
#


# simple implementation of PGD attack (without randomized starting points - cf. BIM)
def PGD(model, feats, labels, epsilon=0.1, alpha=0.01, num_iter=10):

    # initialize image perturbations with zero
    delta = torch.zeros_like(feats, requires_grad=True)
    for t in range(num_iter):
        feats_adv = feats + delta
        outputs = [model(f) for f in feats_adv]

        # forward & backward pass through the model, accumulating gradients
        l = loss(torch.stack(outputs), labels)
        l.backward()

        # use gradients with respect to inputs and clip the results to lie within the epsilon boundary
        delta.data = (delta + alpha * delta.grad.detach().sign()).clamp(-epsilon, epsilon)
        delta.grad.zero_()
    return delta.detach()

# We can see the devastating effect of a simple PGD attack using a perturbation strength
# :math:`\varepsilon=0.1`, where the model misclassifies each of the four samples we used for
# visualization of the dataset. For humans, the images are still very easily classifiable, the
# perturbations look mostly like random noise added to the images. All in all, the accuracy of the
# model for the perturbed trainset decreases to around :math:`0.1`, so almost all samples of the
# dataset are misclassified!
#
# Using the code above, you can try the attack on your own and check which samples are more robust
# against attacks and which labels the model (wrongly) assigns to the data. The remaining question is:
# Can we defend against such attacks? How can we train our (QML) models to be more robust against
# adversarial attacks? This is a field of much active research and in general a very hard problem to
# solve for different kinds of attacks, model architectures and input data, but a very simple approach
# is given below.
#

######################################################################
# Increasing the robustness of QML models
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The easiest way to make our model aware of slight modifications is to simply include the perturbed
# images into the training dataset (this can be seen as data augmentation and is often done in
# classical machine learning using noise). That way, the model is expected to be more robust against
# samples that were constructed using the same attack without changing anything in the model
# architecture itself; this method is called **adversarial (re)training**.

# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# In this demo we saw how to perform adversarial attacks on quantum variational classification models.
# The resulting perturbed images (which - for humans - still closely resemble the original ones)
# result in large misclassification rates of the QML models, showing the vulnerability of such models
# to adversarial attacks. Consequently, we showcased one possibility to increase the adversarial
# robustness using adversarial retraining, which led the model under attack to perform better.
#
# While this method does seem useful, it needs to be noted that this is a very basic approach (just
# include the pertubed images in the trainset, duh!) and might not work equally well for a different
# attack or slightly changed epsilon values. There are approaches (e.g. using Lipschitz regularization
# as shown in [1]) that have the potential to be more effective in increasing the robustness, but this
# is still a field of ongoing research, and many different approaches are waiting to be discovered!

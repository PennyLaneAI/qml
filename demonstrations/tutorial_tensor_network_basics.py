r"""Introducing tensor networks for quantum practicioners
=========================================================

If you are well-versed in the topics of `quantum computing <https://pennylane.ai/qml/what-is-quantum-computing>`__ or quantum information, chances are you have heard (quite often) about tensor networks. In fact, tensor networks are a widely used tool with applications ranging across physics, math, and computer science.

Part of the excitement surrounding tensor networks is due to their ability to represent complex data efficiently, which allows for—among other things—fast classical simulations. In addition, the diagrammatic language accompanying tensor networks makes working with them intuitive and suitable for describing a vast range of mathematical concepts, including quantum circuits.

The :ref:`first part of this tutorial <part_one>` introduces the basic tensor network notions and definitions to quantum practitioners who are familiar with quantum computing but new to tensor networks.

Then, building on this introduction, in the :ref:`second part <part_two>` we explore topics aimed at more seasoned readers. Check this section out if you want to understand how tensor networks and quantum circuits are related!

Without further ado, let’s dive right in! 🤓📚

A first glimpse into the tensor networks world
----------------------------------------------

From matrices to tensors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, we start by answering the question: **what is a tensor?**

A common and intuitive way of thinking about tensors is as generalizations of vectors and matrices. That is, we can think of them as multidimensional arrays—i.e., multidimensional maps that are linear with respect to every parameter. A tensor of dimensions :math:`d_1 \times d_2 \times \ldots \times d_r` can be expressed as

.. math::
    T_{i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_r} \in \mathbb{C}^{d_1 \times d_2 \times \ldots \times d_r},
    
where each :math:`i_n` is an **index** of dimension :math:`d_n` and the number of indices :math:`r` is known as the **rank** of the tensor. We say :math:`T` is a rank-:math:`r` tensor. We will denote the :math:`(i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_r)`-th entry of the tensor :math:`T` as :math:`(T)_{i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_r}` — this is a single number.

For example, a scalar :math:`s` is a rank-0 tensor, a vector :math:`v_i` is a rank-1 tensor, and a matrix :math:`G_{j,i}` is a rank-2 tensor.

.. note::
    Some authors refer to the indices :math:`i_n` as the "dimensions of the tensor". In this tutorial, however, the term **dimension** refers to the range of integer values :math:`d_n` that each index :math:`i_n` can take, namely :math:`i_n \in \{1, \ldots, d_n\}`.
    
A beautiful and powerful tool accompanying tensors is their graphical language representation. The diagram of a tensor is simply a geometric shape with a leg sticking out of it for every index in the tensor. For example,

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/tn_basics/01-tensor.png
    :align: center
    :width: 40%

We can apply this same idea to represent a scalar, a vector, and a matrix:

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/tn_basics/02-tensors.png
    :align: center
    :width: 40%

Does the last diagram seem familiar? It is because this is the representation of a single-qubit gate! Later in this tutorial, we will study the relation between quantum circuits and tensor networks. 

When working within the quantum computing notation, we adopt the convention that drawing the leg of a quantum state (i.e., a vector) to the right corresponds to a ket, i.e., a vector living in the Hilbert space, while drawing the legs to the left means they are a bra vector, i.e., living in the dual space.

    :width: 55%

.. note::
    The diagrammatic representation of tensors is rooted in category theory, which equips the diagrams with all the relevant information so they can be used in proofs and formal reasoning! 💡 [#Selinger2010]_

Creating a tensor in code is straightforward, and chances are you have already created one yourself. Using ``numpy``, all we have to do is create a ``np.array`` of the desired rank. For instance, we can start by creating a rank-1 tensor (a vector).
"""

import numpy as np

tensor_rank1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
print("rank: ", tensor_rank1.ndim)
print("dimensions: ", tensor_rank1.shape)

##############################################################################
# Then, we can use this to construct a rank-2 tensor (a matrix).

tensor_rank2 = np.array([tensor_rank1, tensor_rank1, tensor_rank1])
print("rank: ", tensor_rank2.ndim)
print("dimensions: ", tensor_rank2.shape)

##############################################################################
# As you might have guessed, we can repeat this procedure to create a rank-3 tensor.

tensor_rank3 = np.array([tensor_rank2, tensor_rank2])
print("rank: ", tensor_rank3.ndim)
print("dimensions: ", tensor_rank3.shape)
print("Rank-3 tensor: \n", tensor_rank3)

##############################################################################
# We can create a tensor of arbitrary rank following a similar procedure. This recursive approach illustrates how a rank-:math:`r` tensor can be seen as consisting of nested rank-:math:`(r-1)` tensors. This translates into code as adding another level to the nested bracket structure: ``[tensor_rank_r-1]``.
#
# Now that we understand what a tensor is—and even know how to code one—let us look at how to combine them to create a tensor network.

##############################################################################
# From matrix multiplication to tensor contractions
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Matrix-matrix and matrix-vector multiplications are familiar operations within the context of quantum computing. We can now study these operations through the lens of the tensor notation introduced above. First, a matrix :math:`G` and a vector :math:`v` can be multiplied such that the :math:`j`-th element of the resulting vector is
#
# .. math::
#     (w)_j = \sum_i (G)_{j, i} (v)_i .
#
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/tn_basics/04-matrix-vector.png
#     :align: center
#     :width: 55%
#
# .. note::
#
#   Recall we are adopting the convention of drawing a ket vector with its leg pointing right, as done in quantum circuits. In turn, this means the "input" index of a matrix—its column index—points towards the left while the "output" index—its row index—points to the right. In the example above for :math:`G_{j, i}`, the input and output indices are index :math:`i` and index :math:`j`, respectively.
#
# We see that summing over the shared index :math:`i` is equivalent to **contracting** the corresponding legs from the matrix and vector diagrams. As expected, the result of this multiplication is another rank-1 tensor with dangling leg :math:`j`. Similarly, we can look at the matrix-matrix multiplication :math:`G^3 = G^2 \cdot G^1` and its :math:`(k,i)`-th element is given by 
#
# .. math::
#     (G^3)_{k,i} = \sum_j (G^2)_{k,j} (G^1)_{j,i} .
#
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/tn_basics/05-matrix-matrix.png
#     :align: center
#     :width: 55%
#
# Here, the resulting tensor has two dangling indices, :math:`i` and :math:`k`, defining a matrix, as expected!
#
# We can now generalize this concept to tensors, and consequently, to more than two legs being contracted. For example, let us look at three tensors :math:`A_{i,j,k}`, :math:`B_{j,l,m}`, and :math:`C_{k,m,n}`. To contract them, all we need to do is to sum over repeated indices (:math:`j`, :math:`k`, :math:`m`). To obtain the :math:`(i,l,n)`-th element of the resulting tensor :math:`D`, we perform this contraction by summing over :math:`j, k, m` 
# 
# .. math::
#     (D)_{i,l,n} =  \sum_{j,k,m} (A)_{i,j,k} (B)_{j,l,m} (C)_{k,m,n} .
#
# Using the tensor product :math:`\otimes` between the 3 tensors and summing over the repeated indices we can obtain a similar expression for the full tensor :math:`D` [#Bridgeman2017]_
#
# .. math::
#     D_{i,l,n} = \sum_{j,k,m} A_{i,j,k} \otimes B_{j,l,m} \otimes C_{k,m,n}.
#
# The resulting rank-3 tensor consists of the remaining open legs from the initial tensors :math:`(i,l,n)`. The first equation involving only scalars is the more widely used expression for the contraction operation, and thus, we will use it throughout this tutorial unless otherwise stated. The diagrammatic representation of this contraction is obtained by connecting all the legs with the same indices.
#
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/tn_basics/06-tensor-tensor.png
#     :align: center
#     :width: 55%
#
# With the above contraction, we have formed a network of tensors, i.e., a **tensor network**!
#
# .. note::
#   A common question arising when drawing a tensor is: "What is the correct order to draw the indices?" For instance, in the figure above, we have adopted the convention that a tensor :math:`A_{i,j,k}` corresponds to a diagram with the first leg (:math:`i`) pointing left, the second leg (:math:`j`) pointing upwards, and the third leg (:math:`k`) pointing right, and similarly for the other two tensors. However, this need not be the case. We could have defined the first leg to be the one pointing upwards, for example. Based on the use case, and the user, some conventions might seem more natural than others. The only important thing to keep in mind is to be consistent. In other words, once we choose a convention for the order, we should apply it to all the tensors to avoid contracting the wrong indices.
#
# In our code, we can perform a tensor contraction using the ``numpy`` function ``np.einsum``. To do so, we can start by creating the 3 tensors to be contracted by reshaping a 1D array (created using ``np.arange``) into rank-3 tensors of the correct dimensions.

# Create the individual rank-3 tensors
A = np.arange(6).reshape(1, 2, 3)  # ijk
B = np.arange(6).reshape(2, 3, 1)  # jlm
C = np.arange(6).reshape(3, 1, 2)  # kmn

##############################################################################
# The ``np.einsum`` function takes as inputs the tensors to be contracted and a string showing the indices of each tensor and (optionally) the indices of the output tensor.

D = np.einsum("ijk, jlm, kmn -> iln", A, B, C)
print(D.shape)

##############################################################################
# The CNOT gate
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# 
# To end this section, we want to discuss a common example of a tensor network contraction arising in quantum computing, namely the **CNOT** gate. The `CNOT gate <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.CNOT.html>`__ can be expressed in the computational basis as
#
# .. math::
#   \mathrm{CNOT} = |0\rangle \langle 0 | \otimes I + |1\rangle \langle 1 | \otimes X.
#
# That is, if the control qubit is in the :math:`|1\rangle` state, we apply the :math:`X` gate on the target qubit; otherwise, we leave it untouched. However, we can also rewrite this equation as a contraction. To do so, we define two tensors:
#
# .. math::
#   T^1 = \begin{pmatrix}
#           |0\rangle \langle 0|\\
#           |1\rangle \langle 1 |
#         \end{pmatrix}
#
# and
#
# .. math::
#   T^2 = \begin{pmatrix}
#           I \\
#           X
#         \end{pmatrix}.
#
# This means :math:`T^1_{i,j,k}` and :math:`T^2_{l,j,m}` are two rank-3 tensors, where the index :math:`j` *picks* the elements in the column vector while the other two indices correspond to the indices of the internal tensors (matrices). Specifically, the :math:`j = 0` element of :math:`T^1` and :math:`T^2` are :math:`|0\rangle \langle 0 |` and :math:`I`, respectively; with :math:`|1\rangle \langle 1|` and :math:`X` for their :math:`j = 1` element. This means we can redefine the CNOT expression from above as
#
# .. math::
#   \mathrm{CNOT}_{i,l,k,m} = \sum_j T^1_{i,j,k} \otimes T^2_{l,j,m} .
# 
# We recognize this expression as the second definition for the contraction operation we introduced earlier. Hence, the CNOT gate can be seen as the contraction between :math:`T^1` and :math:`T^2:`
# 
# .. math::
#   (\mathrm{CNOT})_{i,l,k,m} = \sum_j (T^1)_{i,j,k} (T^2)_{l,j,m}. 
# 
# It turns out that :math:`T^1` and :math:`T^2` are special tensors known as the COPY and XOR tensors, respectively, and therefore have special diagrammatic representations. 
#
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/tn_basics/07-t1-t2.png
#     :align: center
#     :width: 60%
#
# Then, their contraction results in the well-known CNOT quantum circuit representation.
#
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/tn_basics/08-cnot.png
#     :align: center
#     :width: 45%
# 
# .. note::
#   By looking at the elements of the COPY tensor, we can interpret them as being equal to :math:`1` when all the indices have the same value (0 or 1) and vanishing otherwise. On the other hand, the elements of the XOR tensor can be understood as being equal to :math:`1` when the values of the three indices contain an even number of 1's and vanishing otherwise. We anticipate that the COPY tensor can be used to obtain the diagonal of a matrix. This will be useful in the last section of this tutorial.
# 
# This demonstrates the relation between the CNOT acting as a rank-4 tensor with dimensions :math:`2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2` and its decomposition in terms of two rank-3 local tensors (:math:`T^1` and :math:`T^2`) of dimensions :math:`2 \times 2 \times 2`.
# 
# .. note::
# 
#   More generally, we can find decompositions of multi-qubit gates into local tensors employing the ubiquitous singular value decomposition (`SVD <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.math.svd.html>`__). This method is explained in detail in our :doc:`introduction to matrix product states for quantum practitioners demo </demos/tutorial_mps>`. This decomposition is helpful when contracting non-local tensors, as is often required in quantum circuits.

##############################################################################
# The cost of contracting a network
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# A common task when dealing with tensors is the contraction of large networks resulting in a single tensor (including scalars). To arrive at this final tensor, we can start with a single tensor and contract it with adjacent tensors one at a time. The order in which this is carried out is known as the **contraction path** or **bubbling**.
# 
# While the final tensor is independent of the order of the contraction, the number of operations performed can vary greatly depending on the order in which we contract the intermediate tensors. Moreover, in a general setup, finding the optimal order of indices to be contracted is not a trivial task.
# 
# .. note::
# 
#   Actually, finding the optimal contraction path of a tensor network with an arbitrary structure is an NP-complete problem [#Arad2010]_.
# 
# For this reason, in this section we will look at how to calculate the computational cost or the **complexity** of a tensor network contraction. First, we look at a simple matrix-matrix contraction. Given two rank-2 tensors :math:`G^1_{j,i}` and :math:`G^2_{k,j}`, we have seen that the :math:`(k,i)`-th element of the resulting contraction along the :math:`j`-th index is
# 
# .. math::
#   (G^3)_{k,i} = \sum_{j=1}^{d_j} (G^2)_{k,j} (G^1)_{j,i},
# 
# where the indices :math:`(i, j, k)` have dimensions :math:`(d_i, d_j, d_k)`, respectively. Thus, obtaining the :math:`(k,i)`-th element requires :math:`\mathcal{O}(d_j)` operations. To construct the full tensor :math:`G^3`, we must repeat this procedure :math:`d_i \times d_k` times (once for every possible value of :math:`i` and :math:`k`). Therefore, the total complexity of the contraction is
# 
# .. math::
#   \mathcal{O}(d_i \times d_j \times d_k)
# 
# To illustrate the importance of choosing an efficient contraction path, let us look at a similar contraction between three rank-3 tensors: :math:`A_{i,j,k} \in \mathbb{C}^{d_i \times d_j \times d_k}`, :math:`B_{j,l,m} \in \mathbb{C}^{d_j \times d_l \times d_m}`, and :math:`C_{k,m,n} \in \mathbb{C}^{d_k \times d_m \times d_n}`.
# 
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/tn_basics/09-contraction.png
#     :align: center
#     :width: 50%
# 
# In particular, let us look at an example where :math:`d_l = 1`, :math:`d_k = d_j = 10`, :math:`d_m = 10^2`, and :math:`d_n = d_i = 10^3`.  First, we look at the complexity of contracting :math:`AB` followed by its contraction with :math:`C`. As outlined in the procedure above, the first contraction results in a complexity of
# 
# .. math::
#   \sum_{j} (A)_{i,j,k} (B)_{j,l,m} \implies \mathcal{O}(d_i \times d_l \times d_m \times d_k \times d_j ) =  \mathcal{O}(d_i \times d_m \times d_j^2 ) = \mathcal{O}(10^3 10^2 (10^1)^2) = \mathcal{O}(10^7)
# 
# Then, contracting the resulting tensor :math:`AB_{i, k, l, m}` with :math:`C_{k,m,n}` requires
# 
# .. math::
#   \sum_{k, m} (AB)_{i, k, l, m} (C)_{k,m,n}  \implies \mathcal{O}(d_i \times d_l \times d_k \times d_m \times d_n) = \mathcal{O}(d_j \times d_m \times d_i^2) = \mathcal{O}(10^1 10^2 (10^3)^2) = \mathcal{O}(10^9)
# 
# operations. Since :math:`d_j < d_m < d_i`, asymptotically, the whole contraction will have a cost of :math:`\mathcal{O}(d_j \times d_m \times d_i^2) = \mathcal{O}(10^9)`. Alternatively, we could first contract :math:`B` and :math:`C`, incurring the cost
# 
# .. math::
#   \sum_{m} (B)_{j,l,m} (C)_{k,m,n} \implies \mathcal{O}(d_j \times d_l \times d_m \times d_k \times d_n) = \mathcal{O}(d_i \times d_m \times d_j^2 ) = \mathcal{O}(10^3 10^2 (10^1)^2) = \mathcal{O}(10^7).
# 
# Then, contracting the resulting tensor with :math:`A` results in
# 
# .. math::
#   \sum_{j, k} (A)_{i,j,k} (BC)_{j,l,k,n}  \implies  \mathcal{O}(d_j \times d_k \times d_l \times d_n \times d_i) = \mathcal{O}(d_i^2 \times d_j^2) = \mathcal{O}((10^3)^2 (10^1)^2) =\mathcal{O}(10^8).
# 
# This means the second contraction path results in an asymptotic cost of :math:`\mathcal{O}(d_i^2 \times d_j^2) = \mathcal{O}(10^8)`—lower than the first contraction path.
# 
# To see this in practice, let us implement the above contractions using ``np.einsum``. First, we create the 3 tensors with the dimensions specified in the example above. We demonstrate a different form of creating tensors of the desired dimensions using the ``random`` module.

import timeit

di = 1000
dm = 100
dj = 10

np.random.seed(20)

A = np.random.rand(di, dj, dj) # ijk
B = np.random.rand(dj,1,dm) # jlm
C = np.random.rand(dj,dm,di) # kmn

##############################################################################
# Then, we perform the individual contractions between pairs of tensors and time them using ``timeit``. We repeat the contraction ``20`` times and average the computation time to account for smaller fluctuations. First, we start by contracting :math:`A` and :math:`B`.

iterations = 20

contraction = "np.einsum('ijk, jlm -> iklm', A, B)"
execution_time = timeit.timeit(contraction, globals=globals(), number=iterations)

time_AB = execution_time * 1000 / iterations
print(f"Computation cost for AB contraction: {time_AB:.8f} ms")

##############################################################################
# Then, we contract the result with :math:`C`.

AB = np.einsum('ijk, jlm -> iklm', A, B)
contraction = "np.einsum('iklm, kmn -> iln', AB, C)"
execution_time = timeit.timeit(contraction, globals=globals(), number=iterations)

time_ABC = execution_time * 1000 / iterations
print(f"Computation cost for (AB)C contraction: {time_ABC:.8f} ms")

##############################################################################
# As expected, the last contraction is much more costly than the first one. We now repeat the procedure, contracting :math:`B` and :math:`C` first. 

contraction = "np.einsum('jlm, kmn -> jlkn', B, C)"
execution_time = timeit.timeit(contraction, globals=globals(), number=iterations)

time_BC = execution_time * 1000 / iterations
print(f"Computation cost for BC contraction: {time_BC:.8f} ms")

##############################################################################
# We see that this contraction is of the same order of magnitude as the contraction between :math:`A` and :math:`B`, as expected from the complexity analysis, since they both yield :math:`\mathcal{O}(d_i \times d_m \times d_j^2 ) = \mathcal{O}(10^7)`. Then, we perform the contraction between the resulting tensor and :math:`A`.

BC = np.einsum('jlm, kmn -> jlkn', B, C)

contraction = "np.einsum('ijk, jlkn -> iln', A, BC)"
execution_time = timeit.timeit(contraction, globals=globals(), number=iterations)

time_BCA = execution_time * 1000 / iterations
print(f"Computation cost for A(BC) contraction: {time_BCA:.8f} ms")

##############################################################################
# We can then compare the total time for each of the paths:

print(f"Computation cost for path 1: {time_AB + time_ABC}")
print(f"Computation cost for path 2: {time_BC + time_BCA}")

##############################################################################
# From this, we see that the second contraction path results in a lower complexity compared to the first one, just as we expected! 💪

# Intermezzo 
# ----------
# 
# So far, we have discussed the definition of a tensor, how to combine them to create a tensor network, and how to calculate the complexity of the contraction operations. Hopefully, after this brief introduction, you will feel more comfortable whenever tensor networks are brought into the conversation.
# 
# Perhaps you even feel motivated to dive deeper into the vast world of tensor networks!
# 
# To help you with this endeavour, in the following sections we will summarize some ubiquitous algorithms used to connect tensor networks and quantum computers. These topics can become quite technical real fast, so we can only scratch the surface in this demo. For this reason, we will reference the relevant sources when pertinent. Now, take a sip of coffee, brace yourself, and let's continue! ☕️

# 
# Connecting tensor networks and quantum circuits
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# 
# Contraction paths
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# In the previous section, we explored how the choice of the contraction path affects the computational cost of the tensor network contraction through a toy example. As shown in [#Lam1997]_, finding an optimal contraction path is equivalent to solving the "multiplication problem," and thus, it is in general NP-hard. In this section, we provide a general description of the widespread techniques used to tackle this ubiquitous task.
# 
# .. note::
# 
#   In special cases, by restricting the geometry and/or the values of the tensor networks, it is possible to find provably efficient contraction paths. A well-studied tensor network ansatz with efficient contraction schemes is the Matrix Product States (MPS) [#Schollwoeck2011]_. This section will, however, focus on tensor networks with arbitrary structures.
# 
# First, we set up the framework of the problem. While multiway contractions—contractions between more than 2 tensors at a time—are possible, we will consider only pairwise contractions since the former can always be decomposed in terms of the latter. In addition, contracting a tensor network doesn't need to result in a single tensor. However, here we consider only the single tensor case as it underlies the more general scenario [#Gray2021]_. 
# 
# The underlying idea behind finding a contraction path is based on the construction of the computational graph, i.e., a rooted binary tree—also known as the **contraction tree**—that specifies the sequence of pairwise contractions to be executed. In this tree structure, a leaf node corresponds to a tensor from the original network (blue tensors) and the pairwise contractions (red lines) give rise to the intermediate tensors (red tensors) corresponding to the rest of the nodes in the contraction tree. 
# 
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/tn_basics/10-contraction-tree.png
#     :align: center
#     :width: 50%
# 
# Transforming a tensor network with an arbitrary structure into this binary tree can be achieved by a **tree embedding** of the tensor network graph [#Bienstock1990]_. Thus, optimization of the contraction path is equivalent to a search over tree embeddings of the network.
# 
# .. note::
# 
#   Besides finding a contraction path that minimizes the computational cost, we can also attempt to find a path that optimizes the memory cost. That is a contraction path in which all intermediate tensors are below a certain size.
# 
# Now, how do we traverse the space of trees to optimize over? The most straightforward idea is to perform an exhaustive search through all of them. As explained in [#Pfeifer2014]_, this can be done (with some additional improvements) using the following well-known algorithms:
# 
# - Depth-first search
# - Breadth-first search
# - Dynamic programming
# 
# While the exhaustive approach scales like :math:`\mathcal{O}(N!)`, with :math:`N` the number of tensors in the network, it can handle a handful of tensors within seconds, providing a good benchmark. In addition, compared to the following algorithms, the exhaustive search guarantees finding the global minimum and optimizing the desired metric - space and/or time.
# 
# .. note::
# 
#   A recursive implementation of the depth-first search is used by default in the well-known package ``opt_einsum`` `(see docs) <https://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/stable/optimal_path.html>`_.
# 
# Further approaches introduced in [#Gray2021]_ are based on alternative common graph-theoretic tasks, rather than searching over the contraction tree space, such as the `balanced bi-partitioning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_number_partitioning>`_ and `community detection <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_structure>`_ algorithms. And even though these are only heuristics that do not guarantee an optimal contraction path, they can often achieve an arbitrarily close to optimal performance. 
# 
# An extra level of optimization, known as **hyper-optimization** is introduced by the use of different algorithms to find the optimal contraction based on the specific tensor network, as some algorithms are better suited for certain network structures. For an in-depth exploration of these heuristics, please refer to [#Gray2021]_.
#
# As we will explore in the next section, we can use tensor networks to simulate quantum circuits. In particular, the calculation of an expectation value corresponds to the contraction of the tensor network into a single tensor (scalar). In ``Pennylane``, this simulation can be performed using the :class:`~pennylane.devices.default_tensor.DefaultTensor` device, and the method used to find the contraction path can be chosen via the ``contraction_optimizer`` keyword argument.

import pennylane as qml

# The different types of values accepted for ``contraction_optimizer`` are determined by the ``optimize`` parameter in ``Quimb`` (see `docs <https://quimb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tensor-circuit.html#finding-a-contraction-path-the-optimize-kwarg>`_) as this is the backend behind the :class:`~pennylane.devices.default_tensor.DefaultTensor` device.

# 
# Slicing
# ^^^^^^^
# 
# The size of (intermediate) tensors can grow exponentially with the number of indices and dimensions, especially for large-scale tensor networks. Thus, we might run into memory problems when performing the contractions. A useful additional technique to split these tensors into more manageable pieces is known as **slicing**. 
# 
# The idea is to change space for computation time, by temporarily fixing the values of some indices in the tensors, performing independently the contraction for each fixed value, and summing the results [#Gray2021]_.
# 
# To end this demo, let us answer the question: **how can we use tensor networks to simulate the output of a quantum circuit?**

##############################################################################
# Quantum circuits are tensor networks
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# Until now, we have looked at general tensor networks, while ✨sparkling✨ the discussions with examples related to quantum circuits. Here, we leverage the components we have learned to explore this relation more in-depth. 
# 
# First, it is important to emphasize that quantum circuits don't just "look" or "behave" like tensor networks, but rather they **are** tensor networks! Quantum circuits are a special class of tensor networks where each horizontal wire corresponds to the Hilbert space of a single qubit and the tensors acting on these subsystems are restricted to be unitary operators, denoting the time evolution of the state (from left to right).
# 
# A general quantum circuit acting on :math:`N` qubits can be expressed in terms of the initial quantum state :math:`| \psi_0 \rangle` and the unitary propagator :math:`U` such that the evolved state is
# 
# .. math::
#   | \psi \rangle = U |\psi_0 \rangle,
# 
# which can also be depicted diagrammatically as
# 
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/tn_basics/11-circuit.png
#     :align: center
#     :width: 45%
# 
# In the right-hand side of the equality we have assumed a specific form for the :math:`U` tensor in terms of local 2-qubit gates, which is often the case when dealing with real quantum hardware. In addition, it is common for the initial state to be a product state such as :math:`|0\rangle^{\otimes N}`, hence the form of the tensor in the diagram as :math:`N` independent tensors of rank-1. However, an arbitrary input state is in general represented as one big rank-:math:`N` tensor.
# 
# Now we can ask ourselves: what quantities can we compute from this tensor network? 🤔
# 
# Expectation values
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# 
# As anticipated in the previous section, a natural quantity to compute using the tensor network arising from a quantum circuit is the expectation value of an observable :math:`O` evaluated at the quantum state :math:`|\psi \rangle`
# 
# .. math::
#   \langle O \rangle = \langle \psi | O | \psi \rangle  = \langle \psi_0| U^\dagger O U |\psi_0 \rangle .
# 
# If the observable is a linear combination of hermitian operators (e.g., a Hamiltonian)
# 
# .. math::
#   O = \sum_i c_i O_i ,
# 
# we can calculate the total expectation value "naïvely" by computing the inner product for each component :math:`O_i` and summing up the weighted results:
# 
# .. math::
#   O = \sum_i c_i \langle O_i \rangle = \sum_i c_i \langle \psi | O_i | \psi \rangle.
# 
# However, it is possible to perform this operation more efficiently using tensor networks by means of a structure called Matrix Product Operator (MPO) [#Pirvu2010]_. The idea is to construct an efficient representation of the observable :math:`O` which can be contracted with the tensor network from :math:`|\psi \rangle`. Constructing these networks efficiently for Hamiltonians of arbitrary structure is an interesting task, which goes beyond the scope of this tutorial.
# 
# When the observable of interest is *local*, i.e., it acts on a few neighbouring qubits, we can calculate the expectation value by considering only the section of the quantum circuit within the **reverse light cone** (causal cone) of the observable :math:`O_l`—i.e., the gates that affect the calculation of the expectation value.
# 
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/tn_basics/12-expectation-local.png
#     :align: center
#     :width: 70%
# 
# Then, the sections outside of the light cone (grayed-out gates in the figure above) can be ignored since these are contractions resulting in the identity: :math:`G G^\dagger = I`. This helps us decrease the size of the tensor to be contracted, and consequently, the computational expense, by focusing on the section of the circuit with support inside the light cone of the observable
# 
# .. math::
#   \langle O_l \rangle = \langle \psi_l | O_l | \psi_l \rangle,
# 
# where :math:`| \psi_l \rangle` is the section of the evolved state within the light cone of :math:`O_l`.
# 
# Sampling
# ^^^^^^^^
# 
# In addition to calculating expectation values, we can also use the tensor network arising from a quantum circuit to sample bitstrings from the evolved probability distribution :math:`| \psi \rangle`—emulating what you would obtain from a real quantum computer. Since this is a ubiquitous task in quantum information, several algorithms have been proposed to generate samples from probability distributions represented as tensor networks. In particular, here we discuss the "Perfect Sampling Algorithm" applied to unitary tensor networks [#Ferris2012]_, as this generates uncorrelated samples, unlike Markov-based approaches.
# 
# .. note::
#   The method used in `Quimb <https://quimb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ (the backend behind :class:`~pennylane.devices.default_tensor.DefaultTensor`) to generate samples from the quantum circuit is also based on this algorithm.
# 
# A cornerstone behind this algorithm is the well-known `chain rule <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule_(probability)>`_, which allows us to write the joint probability of an event using only conditional probabilities. Using this, we can express the probability of sampling the bitstring :math:`(x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_N)` from :math:`| \psi \rangle` as
# 
# .. math::
#   p(x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_N) = p(x_1) p(x_2|x_1) p(x_3| x_1 x_2) \ldots p(x_N | x_1 x_2 x_3 \ldots x_{N-1}).
# 
# Thus, to obtain a sample from the joint distribution on the left side of the equation, we can compute the terms on the right side by means of marginal distributions. First, we start by computing the marginal probability :math:`p(x_1)`. To do so, we compute the reduced density matrix :math:`\rho_{1}` by tracing out all the other qubits:
# 
# .. math::
#   \rho_{1} = \mathrm{Tr}_{2,3,\ldots,N}(| \psi \rangle \langle \psi |).
# 
# Then, the diagonal of this :math:`2 \times 2` density matrix gives us the probability of sampling 0 or 1, i.e., :math:`p(x_1 = 0)` and :math:`p(x_1 = 1)`. This diagonal corresponds to the following probability vector
# 
# .. math::
#   | p_{x_1} \rangle = \sum_{i=0}^{1} p(x_1=i) | i \rangle =  \mathrm{diag}(\rho_1) = \mathrm{diag}\left( \mathrm{Tr}_{2,3,\ldots,N}(| \psi \rangle \langle \psi |) \right).
# 
# The tensor network corresponding to the computation of this vector is
# 
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/tn_basics/13-sample.png
#     :align: center
#     :width: 70%
# .. note:: 
#   In this diagram, we have extracted the diagonal of the reduced density matrix by contracting it with the COPY tensor introduced earlier in this tutorial!
# 
# Once we obtain the probability vector, we can generate a random sample weighted by these probabilities. To do so, we generate a random number :math:`r \in [0,1]` and choose :math:`x_1 = 0` if :math:`r < p(x_1=0)` and :math:`x_1 = 1` otherwise. We save this sample as :math:`\hat{x}_1`.
# 
# Next, we can calculate the following term :math:`p(x_2|\hat{x}_1)` conditioned on the sample we have just obtained. To accomplish this, we *project* the first qubit to be :math:`\hat{x}_1`. We can do this by contracting the computational basis state :math:`| \hat{x}_1 \rangle` with :math:`|\psi \rangle`, resulting in a smaller state :math:`|\psi_{x_1} \rangle`. Then, we can proceed exactly as we did in the previous step, calculating the reduced density matrix :math:`\rho_2` by tracing out the remaining qubits :math:`3,4,\ldots, N` and computing the probability vector from its diagonal
# 
# .. math::
#   | p_{x_2 | \hat{x}_1} \rangle  = \mathrm{diag} \left( \mathrm{Tr}_{3,4, \ldots,N}(| \psi_{x_1} \rangle \langle \psi_{x_1} |) \right).
# 
# From this vector, we sample the next value :math:`\hat{x}_2` (just like we sampled :math:`\hat{x}_1`) and use it to compute the next term :math:`p(x_3| \hat{x}_1 \hat{x}_2)` using the same procedure. The following diagram shows the full tensor network for this step including the projection onto the computational basis state :math:`| \hat{x}_1 \rangle`.
# 
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/tn_basics/14-sample-cntd.png
#     :align: center
#     :width: 70%
# 
# Analogously as done with the expectation values, these contractions only involve the sections of the circuit within the light cone of *both* the projection with :math:`| \hat{x}_1 \rangle` and the contraction with the COPY tensor (diagonal computation). This procedure can be repeated recursively using the chain rule equation until we obtain the full bitstring :math:`(\hat{x}_1, \hat{x}_2, \hat{x}_3, \ldots, \hat{x}_N)`. Then to obtain more samples, we just repeat the procedure from the beginning!
# 
# .. note::
#   By generating each bitstring independently from each other, i.e., by restarting the sampling algorithm without knowledge of the previous samples, we ensure perfect sampling from the probability distribution, contrary to other Markov-based algorithms [#Schuch2008]_ . We then say the sample is *memoryless*.
# 
# We can reduce the computational cost of the sampling algorithm by **caching** results from previous contractions. When we draw a new sample that partially matches a previously explored configuration (marginal probability), we can reuse the cached results and avoid contracting this part of the network over again. 
# 
# For example, let's assume we have performed the perfect sampling algorithm once and obtained the sample :math:`0110`. If the next sample we need to generate starts with the substring :math:`01`, we can reuse the marginal probabilities up to :math:`p(x_3|01)` and only calculate the new parts of the sequence. The same caching idea can be applied to other tensor network algorithms involving many contractions.

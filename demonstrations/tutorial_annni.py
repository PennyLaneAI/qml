r"""Supervised and Unsupervised Quantum Machine Learning Models for the Phase Detection of the ANNNI Spin Model
==========================================================

Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models provide a natural framework for analyzing quantum many-body systems due to the direct mapping between spins and qubits.

A key property of these systems is their phase diagram, which characterizes different physical phases based on parameters such as magnetization or the strength of interactions. 
These diagrams help identify transitions where the system undergoes sudden changes in behaviour, which is essential for understanding the fundamental properties of quantum materials and optimizing quantum technologies.

Following the same approach as in the paper on `Quantum phase detection generalization from marginal quantum neural network models <https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.107.L081105>`_, 
we explore the phase diagram of the Axial Next-Nearest-Neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model using both supervised and unsupervised learning methods:

* **Supervised model**: The Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) is trained on a small subset of analytically known phase points, demonstrating its ability to generalize beyond the training data.

* **Unsupervised model**: Quantum Anomaly Detection (QAD) requires minimal prior knowledge and efficiently identifies potential phase boundaries, making it a valuable tool for systems with unknown structures.

The ANNNI model
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ANNNI model describes a spin system with three types of competing interactions. Its Hamiltonian is given by

.. math::  H =   -J \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sigma_x^i\sigma_x^{i+1} - \kappa \sigma_x^{i}\sigma_x^{i+2} + h \sigma_z^i, \tag{1}

where

* :math:`\sigma_a^i` are the Pauli matrices acting on the :math:`i`-th spin (:math:`a \in \{x, y, z\}`),

* :math:`J` is the nearest-neighbor coupling constant, which we set to :math:`1` without any loss of generality,

* :math:`\kappa` controls the strength next-nearest-neighbor interaction,

* and :math:`h` represents the the transverse magnetic field strength.

Without loss of generality, we set :math:`J = 1` and consider open boundary conditions for positive :math:`\kappa` and :math:`h`.

We start by importing the necessary libraries for simulation, optimization, and plotting our results, 
as well as setting some important constants:

# For simplicity, in this demo, we compute the ground state directly by finding the *eigenvector* corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian. The resulting states are then loaded into the quantum circuits using PennyLane’s :class:`~pennylane.StatePrep`.

# Supervised learning of phases: QCNN
# -----------------------------------
#
# QCNNs are a class of quantum circuits first introduced in [#Cong]_, inspired by their classical counterparts, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Like CNNs, QCNNs aim to learn representations from input data by leveraging its local properties. In this implementation, these local properties correspond to the interactions between neighbouring spins.
#
# A QCNN consists of two main components:
#
# * **Convolution layers**: alternating unitaries are applied to pairs of neighbouring spins.
#
# * **Pooling layers**: half of the qubits are measured, and based on the measurement outcome, different rotations are applied to the remaining qubits.
#
# For the output, we consider the model’s probability vector :math:`P(\kappa, h)` over the four computational basis states of the final two-qubit system, obtained using :func:`~pennylane.probs`. Each computational basis state is mapped to a specific phase as follows.
#
# * :math:`\vert 00 \rangle`: Ferromagnetic.
# * :math:`\vert 01 \rangle`: Antiphase.
# * :math:`\vert 10 \rangle`: Paramagnetic.
# * :math:`\vert 11 \rangle`: Trash class.
#
# Circuit definition
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# We now define and implement the QCNN circuit. The `qcnn_ansatz` function builds the QCNN architecture by alternating convolution and pooling layers 
# until only two qubits remain. The `qcnn_circuit` function embeds an input quantum state through :class:`~pennylane.StatePrep`, applies the QCNN ansatz, and returns 
# the probability distribution over the final two-qubit system. Finally, we vectorize the circuit for efficient evaluation.

# Unsupervised learning of phases: Quantum Anomaly Detection
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# 
# Quantum Anomaly Detection (QAD), introduced in [#Kottmann]_, is the quantum version of an autoencoder. However, unlike classical autoencoders, only the encoding (forward) process is trained here. This is because quantum operations are invertible, making a separate decoder unnecessary.
# 
# In this method, we start with a single quantum state :math:`|\psi(\kappa, h)\rangle` taken from the ANNNI model. The goal is to optimize the parameters :math:`\theta` of a quantum circuit :math:`V(\theta)` so that it transforms the chosen input state into the following form:
# 
# .. math::  V(\theta)|\psi(\kappa, h)\rangle = |\phi\rangle^{N-K} \otimes |0\rangle^{\otimes K}\tag{6}
# 
# The equation above means that we are trying to find a unitary transformation that "compresses" the important information of the original state into a smaller number of qubits :math:`(N-K)`, while disentangling and resetting the remaining :math:`K` qubits to the trivial state :math:`|0\rangle`. In other words, the circuit learns to isolate the relevant features of the quantum state into :math:`|\phi\rangle`.

# We now define and implement the QAD circuit. The `anomaly_ansatz` function builds the QAD architecture.

# After training the circuit to optimally compress the (0,0) state, we evaluate the compression score for all other input states using the learned parameters.
# 
# The model is expected to achieve near-optimal compression for states similar to the training state (namely those belonging to the same phase) resulting in a low compression score. Conversely, states from different phases should exhibit poorer compression, leading to a higher compression score.

# Evaluate the compression score for each state in the phase diagram

# 
# As expected, the compression score is nearly zero within the ferromagnetic phase, while higher scores are observed in the other regions. Surprisingly, the other regions display distinct compression scores that remain consistent within their respective areas.
# 
# Using this model, we can clearly identify the three phases and their locations. Furthermore, as observed in [#Cea]_, by increasing the system size (around ~20 spins), a fourth phase emerges in the anticipated floating phase region. These regions are expected to become more sharply defined at larger system sizes, with more pronounced transitions between phases.
# 
# Conclusion
# -----------
#
# Quantum many-body systems present a compelling use case for QML models. In this tutorial, we explored two different approaches:
#
# * **Supervised learning**: the QCNN effectively generalizes phase classification beyond its training data, aligning with phase boundaries identified by classical methods.
#
# * **Unsupervised learning**: QAD successfully distinguishes different quantum phases without requiring labelled training data, making it ideal for systems with unknown structures.
#
# These techniques could be valuable for studying spin systems beyond classical simulability, particularly when non-local interactions are present and tensor network methods become inadequate.

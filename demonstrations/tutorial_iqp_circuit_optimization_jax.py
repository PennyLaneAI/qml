r"""Fast optimization of instantaneous quantum polynomial circuits
===============================================================

Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuits are a class of circuits that are expected to be hard
to sample from using classical computers [#marshall1]_. In this demo, we take a look at the `IQPopt <https://github.com/XanaduAI/iqpopt>`__ package [#recio1]_,
which shows that despite this, such circuits can still be optimized efficiently!

As we will see, this hinges on a surprising fact about these circuits: while sampling is hard,
estimating expectation values of certain observables is easy.

Parameterized IQP circuits
--------------------------

IQPopt is designed to optimize a class of IQP circuits called *parameterized IQP circuits*. These are
comprised of gates :math:`\text{exp}(i\theta_j X_j)`, where the generator :math:`X_j` is a tensor
product of `Pauli X operators <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.PauliX.html>`__ acting on some subset of qubits and :math:`\theta_j` is a trainable
parameter. We will represent the parameterized gates by a list

#
# that specifies the generators of the gates (each generator with an independent trainable parameter).
# Each element of ``gates`` is associated with a different parameter, and is a list of lists of integers
# that specifies the generator for that parameter. For example,

# .. raw:: html
#
#    <center>
#
# ``gen1 = [[0,1]]``
#
# .. raw:: html
#
#    </center>
#
# specifies that the generator of the first gate is :math:`X\otimes X` acting on
# the first two qubits of the circuit, i.e. `wires` `0` and `1`. We can also define generators that are sums
# of tensor products of Pauli X operators by including more elements. For example,
#
# .. raw:: html
#
#    <center>
#
# ``gen1 = [[0,1], [0]]``
#
# .. raw:: html
#
#    </center>
#
# would correspond to a gate with a single parameter with generator :math:`X\otimes X` +
# :math:`X\otimes I`.
#
# Here we will work with the following set of gates
#
gates = [[[0]], [[1]], [[2]], [[0,1]], [[0,2]], [[1,2]]]

# i.e. one and two body generators acting on three qubits, each with an independent parameter.
#
# Expectation values
# ------------------
#
# IQPopt can be applied to problems that involve measuring expectation values of tensor products of Pauli Z observables of
# parameterized IQP circuits.
#
# We will represent these observables with binary lists, where a nonzero element denotes the
# presence of a Pauli Z operator on that qubit. For example, in a three-qubit circuit, the operator
#
# .. math:: O = Z \otimes I \otimes Z
#
# will be represented as

# Pauli X operators by Pauli Z operators in :math:`X_j`. Our PennyLane circuit (with input state
# :math:`\vert 0 \rangle`) is therefore the following.

# Estimating expectation values with IQPopt
# -----------------------------------------
#
# IQPopt can perform the same operations our PennyLane circuit above, although using approximations instead of exact values. The benefit is that we can work with very
# large circuits.
#
# Starting from a paper on simulating quantum computers with probabilistic methods [#nest]_ from Van den Nest (Theorem 3), one can arrive at the following expression
# for expectation values of Pauli Z operators
#
# .. math:: \langle Z_{\boldsymbol{a}} \rangle = \mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{z}\sim U}\Big[ \cos\Big(\sum_j \theta_{j}(-1)^{\boldsymbol{g}_{j}\cdot \boldsymbol{z}}(1-(-1)^{\boldsymbol{g}_j\cdot \boldsymbol{a}}\Big) \Big],
#
# where:
#
# - :math:`\boldsymbol{a}` is the bitstring representation of the operator whose expectation value we want to compute.
# - :math:`\boldsymbol{z}` represents bitstring samples drawn from the uniform distribution :math:`U`.
# - :math:`\theta_{j}` are the trainable parameters.
# - :math:`\boldsymbol{g}_{j}` are the different generators, also represented as bitstrings.
#
# Although this expression is exact, computing the expectation exactly requires an infinite number of samples :math:`\boldsymbol{z}`. Instead, we can
# replace the expectation with an empirical mean and compute an unbiased estimate of
# :math:`\langle Z_{\boldsymbol{a}} \rangle` efficiently. That is, if we sample a batch of :math:`s`
# bitstrings :math:`\{\boldsymbol{z}_i\}` from the uniform distribution and compute the sample mean
#
# .. math:: \hat{\langle Z_{\boldsymbol{a}}\rangle} = \frac{1}{s}\sum_{i}\cos\Big(\sum_j \theta_j(-1)^{\boldsymbol{g}_j\cdot \boldsymbol{z}_i}(1-(-1)^{\boldsymbol{g}_j\cdot \boldsymbol{a}})\Big),
#
# we obtain an unbiased estimate :math:`\hat{\langle Z_{\boldsymbol{a}}\rangle}` of
# :math:`\langle Z_{\boldsymbol{a}}\rangle`, meaning that
#
# .. math:: \mathbb{E}[\hat{\langle Z_{\boldsymbol{a}}\rangle}] = \langle Z_{\boldsymbol{a}}\rangle
#
# The error of this approximation is well known since, by the central limit theorem, the standard
# deviation of the sample mean of a bounded random variable decreases as
#
# .. math:: \mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{s})
#
# where :math:`s` is the number of samples.
#
# Let's see now how to use the IQPopt package to calculate expectation values, based on the same
# arguments in the previous example. First, we create the circuit object with ``IqpSimulator``,
# which takes in the number of qubits ``n_qubits`` and the ``gates`` in our usual format:
#
import iqpopt as iqp

small_circuit = iqp.IqpSimulator(n_qubits, gates)

######################################################################
# To obtain estimates of expectation values we use the class method ``IqpSimulator.op_expval()``. This
# function requires a parameter array ``params``, a PauliZ operator specified by its binary
# representation ``op``, a new parameter ``n_samples`` (the number of samples :math:`s`) that controls
# the precision of the approximation (the more the better), and a JAX pseudo random number generator
# key to seed the randomness of the sampling. It returns the expectation value estimate as well as its
# standard error.
#
# Using the same ``params`` and ``op`` as before:
#
import jax

n_samples = 2000
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(66)

expval, std = small_circuit.op_expval(params, op, n_samples, key)

print("Expectation value:  ", expval)
print("Standard error: ", std)

######################################################################
# Since the calculation in IQPopt is stochastic, the result is not exactly the same as
# the one obtained with PennyLane. However, as we can see, they are within the standard error `std`. You can try
# increasing ``n_samples`` in order to obtain a more accurate approximation.
#
# Additionally, this function supports fast batch evaluation of expectation values. By specifying a batch of operators ``ops`` as an array, we can compute expectation values and errors in parallel using the same syntax.
#
ops = np.array([[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]) # batch of single qubit Pauli Zs

expvals, stds = small_circuit.op_expval(params, ops, n_samples, key)

print("Expectation values: ", expvals)

# Sampling and probabilities
# --------------------------
#
# If we measure the output qubits of an IQP circuit, we generate samples of binary vectors according to
# the distribution
#
# .. math:: q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{x}) \equiv q(\boldsymbol{x}\vert\boldsymbol{\theta})=\vert (\langle \boldsymbol{x} \vert U(\boldsymbol{\theta})\vert 0 \rangle )\vert^2,
#
# where :math:`U(\boldsymbol{\theta})` is the parametrized IQP circuit. For a low number of qubits, we
# can use PennyLane to obtain the output probabilities of the circuit as well as sample from it. Note
# that there is not an efficient algorithm to do this for large numbers of qubits, so PennyLane
# returns an error in this case.
#
# These functions are already implemented in the ``IqpSimulator`` object. The ``.probs()`` method
# works as it does in PennyLane, where the returned array of probabilities is in lexicographic order.
#
sample = small_circuit.sample(params, shots=1)

# Optimizing an IQPopt circuit
# ----------------------------

# Circuits can be optimized via a separate ``Trainer`` class. To instantiate a trainer object, we first

# Generative machine learning tools
# ---------------------------------
#
# The package contains a dedicated module ``gen_qml`` with functionality to train and evaluate
# generative models expressed as ``IqpSimulator`` circuits. Note that, since sampling from IQP circuits
# is hard, these circuits may lead to advantages for generative machine learning tasks relative to
# classical models!
#
# Training via the maximum mean discrepancy loss
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) [#gretton]_ is an integral probability metric that measures the
# similarity between two probability distributions and can serve as a loss function to train
# generative models. We will focus on the square of the MMD, which can be written as
#
# .. math::  \text{MMD}^2(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y}\sim q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} }[k(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y})] - 2  \mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{x} \sim q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}},\boldsymbol{y}\sim p }[k(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y})] + \mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y}\sim p }[k(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y})] \,,

# Using a Gaussian kernel,
#
# .. math::  k(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y}) = \exp\Big(\frac{\vert\vert \boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{y} \vert\vert^2}{2\sigma^2}\Big) \,,
#
# it has one parameter called ``sigma``, the bandwidth of this kernel. The
# squared MMD is typically calculated using samples from both probability distributions, and we have an implementation available for this in the ``gen_qml`` module.

# Conclusion
# ---------------------------------
#
# As a final takeaway, IQPopt stands out as perhaps the only tool that enables researchers to analyze large-scale circuits with potential advantages using numerical methods. By doing so, it opens up opportunities
# to explore systems that are too intricate for traditional pen-and-paper calculations and, as a
# result, it has the potential to uncover insights that were previously inaccessible.

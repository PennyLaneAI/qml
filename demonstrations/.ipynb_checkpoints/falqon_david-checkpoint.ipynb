    "## Introduction to FALQON\n",

    "In this demo, we'll be implement the [FALQON](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08619.pdf) algorithm, standing for *Feedback-based ALgorithm for Quantum OptimizatioN*. It is similar in spirit to the [QAOA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4028.pdf), but scales with resources differently, and involves iterative feedback steps rather than a global optimization over parameters.\n",

    "To solve combinatorial optimization problems using a quantum computer, a typical strategy is to encode the solution to the problem as the ground state of *cost Hamiltonian* $H_C$, and choose some strategy to drive the system from a known initial state into this ground state. FALQON falls under this broad scheme. The driving strategy is implemented with a *driving Hamiltonian* $H_D$ with a single control parameter $\\beta(t)$, so the system evolves according to\n",

    "Using techniques from [control theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.3997.pdf), it is possible to show this will eventually drive the system into the ground state. But there are two issues: (a) first, we need to somehow *evaluate* the expectation $A(t) := i\\langle [H_D, H_C] \\rangle_t$ to implement the driving strategy, and (b) we must do so continuously in time! This seems rather impractical. In order to solve the first problem, we can perform a [Trotter-Suzuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_product_formula) decomposition of the time evolution operator $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = U(t)|\\psi_0\\rangle$:\n",

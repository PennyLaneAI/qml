JAX is an incredibly powerful scientific computing library that has been gaining traction in
both the physics and deep learning communities. While JAX was originally designed for 
classical machine learning (ML), many of its transformations are also useful 
for quantum machine learning (QML), and can be used directly with PennyLane.

# In this tutorial, we'll go over a number of JAX transformations and show how you can
# use them to build and optimize quantum circuits. We'll show examples of how to 
# do gradient descent with ``jax.grad``, run quantum circuits in parallel
# using ``jax.vmap``, compile and optimize simulations with ``jax.jit``,
# and control and seed the random nature of quantum computer simulations
# with ``jax.random``. By the end of this tutorial you should feel just as comfortable
# transforming quantum computing programs with JAX as you do transforming your 
# neural networks.
#
# If this is your first time reading PennyLane code, we recommend going through
# the :doc:`basic tutorial </demos/tutorial_qubit_rotation>`
# first. It's all in vanilla NumPy, so you should be able to 
# easily transfer what you learn to JAX when you come back.
#
# With that said, we begin by importing PennyLane, JAX,  the JAX-provided version of NumPy and
# set up a two-qubit device for computations. We'll be using the ``default.qubit`` device
# for the first part of this tutorial.

# Added to silence some warnings.

# then evaluates the expectation value of the Pauli-Z operator on the first wire.

    # These two gates represent our QML model.

    # The expval here will be the "cost function" we try to minimize.
    # Usually, this would be defined by the problem we want to solve,
    # but for this example we'll just use a single PauliZ.
    return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

##############################################################################
# Notice that the output of the circuit is a JAX ``DeviceArray``.
# In fact, when we use the ``default.qubit`` device, the entire computation 
# is done in JAX, so we can use all of the JAX tools out of the box!
#
# Now let's move on to an example of a transformation. The code we wrote above is entirely 
# differentiable, so let's calculate its gradient with ``jax.grad``.
print("\nGradient Descent")

# via gradient descent.

# And that's QML in a nutshell! If you've done classical machine learning before,
# the above training loop should feel very familiar to you. The only difference is
# that we used a quantum computer (or rather, a simulation of one) as part of our
# model and cost calculation. In the end, almost all QML problems involve tuning some
# parameters and minimizing some cost function, just like classical ML.
# While classical ML focuses on learning classical systems like language or vision,
# QML is most useful for learning about quantum systems. For example, 
# :doc:`finding chemical ground states </demos/tutorial_vqe>` 
# or learning to :doc:`sample thermal energy states </demos/tutorial_vqt>`.

# We just showed how we can use gradient methods to learn a parameter value, 
# but on real quantum computing hardware, calculating gradients can be really expensive and noisy.
# Another approach is to use `evolutionary strategies <https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00101>`__
# (ES) to learn these parameters.
# Here, we will be using the ``jax.vmap`` `transform <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#jax.vmap>`__
# to make running batches of circuits much easier. ``vmap`` essentially transforms a single quantum computer into
# multiple running in parallel!

# Let's now set up our ES training loop. The idea is pretty simple. First, we
# calculate the expected values of each of our parameters. The cost values
# then determine the "weight" of that example. The lower the cost, the larger the weight.
# These batches are then used to generate a new set of parameters. 

# Needed to do randomness with JAX.

# How to use jax.jit: Compiling Circuit Execution
# -----------------------------------------------
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/jax_logo/jaxjit.png
#     :width: 50%

#
# JAX is built on top of `XLA <https://www.tensorflow.org/xla>`__, a powerful 
# numerics library that can optimize and cross compile computations to different hardware, 
# including CPUs, GPUs, etc. JAX can compile its computation to XLA via the ``jax.jit`` 
# `transform. <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html?highlight=jit#jax.jit>`__
# 
# When compiling an XLA program, the compiler will do several rounds of optimization
# passes to enhance the performance of the computation. Because of this compilation overhead,
# you'll generally find the first time calling the function to be slow, but all subsequent
# calls are much, much faster. You'll likely want to do it if you're running
# the same circuit over and over but with different parameters, like you would find in almost
# all variational quantum algorithms.

# Compiling your circuit with JAX is very easy, just add jax.jit!

import time

# No jit.

# JAX runs async, so .block_until_ready() blocks until the computation
# is actually finished. You'll only need to use this if you're doing benchmarking.

# You can see that for the cost of some compilation overhead, we can
# greatly increase our performance of our simulation by orders of magnitude.

# Shots and Sampling with JAX
# ----------------------------
# 
# JAX was designed to enable experiments to be as repeatable as possible. Because of this,
# JAX requires us to seed all randomly generated values (as you saw in the above
# batching example). Sadly, the universe doesn't allow us to seed real quantum computers,
# so if we want our JAX to mimic a real device, we'll have to handle randomness ourselves.
#
# To learn more about how JAX handles randomness, visit their
# `documentation site. <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.random.html>`__
#
# .. note:: 
#     This example only applies if you are using ``jax.jit``. Otherwise, PennyLane 
#     automatically seeds and resets the random-number-generator for you on each call.
#
# To set the random number generating key, you'll have to pass the ``jax.random.PRNGKey``
# when constructing the device. Because of this, if you want to use ``jax.jit`` with randomness,
# the device construction will have to happen within that jitted method.

print("\n\nRandomness")
print("----------")

# Let's create our circuit with randomness and compile it with jax.jit.

    # Also note the added '.jax' to the device path.
    dev = qml.device("default.qubit.jax", wires=2, shots=10, prng_key=key)

    # Now we can create our qnode within the circuit function.
    @qml.qnode(dev, interface="jax", diff_method=None)
    def my_circuit():
        qml.RX(param, wires=0)

    return my_circuit()

key1 = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)
key2 = jax.random.PRNGKey(1)

# Notice that the first two runs return exactly the same results,
print(f"key1: {circuit(key1, jnp.pi/2)}")

# Closing Remarks
# ----------------
# By now, using JAX with PennyLane should feel very natural. They 
# complement each other very nicely; JAX with its powerful transforms, and PennyLane 
# with its easy access to quantum computers. We're still in early days of 
# development, but we hope to continue to grow our ecosystem around JAX,
# and by extension, grow JAX into quantum computing and quantum machine learning.
# The future looks bright for this field, and we're excited to see what you build!

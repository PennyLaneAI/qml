JAX is an incredibly powerful scientific computing library that has been gaining traction in
both the physics and deep learning community. While JAX was originally designed for 
classical machine learning (ML), many of its transformations are also useful 
for quantum machine learning (QML), and can be used directly with PennyLane.

# JAX's main selling point is its function transformations, and nearly all of 
# them can be used in quantum computing contexts.
# 
# In this tutorial, we'll go over the many JAX transformations and show how you can
# use them to build and optimize quantum circuits. We'll show examples of how to 
# do gradient descent with ``jax.grad``, run quantum circuits in parallel
# using ``jax.vmap``, compile and optimize simulations with ``jax.jit``
# and control and seed the random nature of quantum computer simulations
# with ``jax.random``. By the end of this tutorial you should feel just as comfortable
# transforming quantum computing programs with JAX as you do transforming your 
# neural network code.
#
# If this is your first time reading PennyLane code, we recommend going through
# the :doc:`basic tutorial </demos/tutorial_qubit_rotation>`
# first. It's all in vanilla NumPy, so you should be able to 
# easily transfer what you learn to JAX when you come back.
#
# With that said, we begin by importing PennyLane, JAX and the JAX-provided version of NumPy and
# set up a two-qubit device for computations. We'll be using the ``default.qubit`` device
# for the first part of this tutorial.

# Added to silence some warnings.

# then evaluates the expectation value of the Pauli-Z operator on the first wire.

    # The expval here will be the "cost function" we try to minimize.
    # Usually, this would be defined by the problem we want to solve,
    # but for this example we'll just use a single PauliZ.
    return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

# Notice that the output of the circuit is a JAX ``DeviceArray``.
# In fact, when we use the ``default.qubit`` device, the entire computation 
# is done in JAX, so we can use all of the JAX tools out of the box!

# And that's QML in a nutshell! If you've done classical machine learning before,
# the above training loop should feel very familiar to you. The only difference is
# that we used a quantum computer (or rather, a simulation of one) as part of our
# model and cost calculation. In the end, almost all QML problems involve tuning some
# parameters and making some cost function go down, just like classical ML.
# While classical ML focuses on learning classical systems like language or vision,
# QML is most useful for learning quantum systems like finding chemical ground states
# or learning to :doc:`sample thermal energy states </demos/tutorial_vqt>`.

# Batching and Evolutionary Strategies
# -------------------------------------
#
# We just showed how we can use gradient methods to learn a parameter value, 
# but on real QC hardware, calculating gradients can be really expensive and noisy.
# Another approach is to use evolutionary strategies (ES) to learn these parameters.
# Here, we will be using the ``jax.vmap`` `transform <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#jax.vmap>`__
# to make running batches of circuits much easier.

print("\n\nBatching and Evolutionary Strategies")
print("------------------------------------")

# Create a vectorized version of our original circuit.
vcircuit = jax.vmap(circuit)

# Now, we call the ``vcircuit`` with multiple parameters at once and get back a
# batch of expectations.
batch_params = jnp.array([1.02, .123, -0.571])
batched_results = vcircuit(batch_params)
print(f"Batched result: {batched_results}")

##############################################################################
# Let's now set up our ES training loop. The idea is pretty simple. First, we
# calculate the expected values of each of our parameters. The cost values
# then determine the "weight" of that example. The lower the cost, the larger the weight.
# These batches are then used to generate a new set of parameters. 

# Needed to do randomness with JAX.
# For more info on how JAX handles randomness, see
# `the documentation <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.random.html>`__
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)

# Generate our first set of samples.
params = jax.random.normal(key, (100,))
mean = jnp.average(params)
var = 1.0
print(f"Initial value: {mean:0.3f}")
print(f"Initial cost: {circuit(mean):0.3f}")

for _ in range(200):
    # In this line, we run all 100 circuits in parallel.
    costs = vcircuit(params)

    # Use exp(-x) here since the costs could be negative.
    weights = jnp.exp(-costs) 
    mean = jnp.average(params, weights=weights)

    # The variance should decrease as we converge to a solution.
    var = var * 0.97
    # Split the JAX key.

# How to use jax.jit: Compiling Circuit Execution
# -----------------------------------------------
#
# JAX is built on top of `XLA <https://www.tensorflow.org/xla>`__, a powerful 
# numerics library that can optimize and cross compile computations to different hardware, 
# including CPUs, GPUs, etc. JAX can compile it's computation to XLA via the ``jax.jit`` 
# `transform. <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html?highlight=jit#jax.jit>`__
# 
# When compiling an XLA program, the compiler will do several rounds of optimization
# passes to enhance the performance of the computation. Because of this compilation overhead,
# you'll generally find the first time calling the function to be slow, but all subsequent
# calls are much, much faster. You'll likely want to do it if you're running
# the same circuit over and over but with different parameters.
# 
# To compile your quantum simulation to XLA, you can use the

print("\n\nJit Example")
print("-----------")

# Compiling your circuit with JAX is very easy, just add the jax.jit decorator!
@jax.jit # The decorator can be directly applied to a QNode.

# is finished.

# Much faster every time after!
start = time.time()

# Shots and Sampling with JAX
# ----------------------------
# 
# JAX was designed to have experiments be as repeatable as possible. Because of this,
# JAX requires us to seed all randomly generated values (as you saw in the above
# batching example). Sadly, the universe doesn't allow us to seed real quantum computers,
# so if we want our JAX to mimic a real QC, we'll have to handle randomness ourselves.
#
# To learn more about how JAX handles randomness, visit their
# `documentation site. <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.random.html>`__
#
# Note: This example only applies if you are using ``jax.jit``. Otherwise, PennyLane 
# automatically seeds and resets the random-number-generator for you on each call.
#
# To set the random number generating key, you'll have to pass the ``jax.random.PRNGKey``
# when constructing the device. Because of this, if you want to use ``jax.jit`` with randomness,
# the device construction will have to happen within that jitted method.

print("\n\nRandomness")
print("----------")

# Let's create our circuit with randomness and compile it with jax.jit.
@jax.jit
def circuit(key, param):
    # Notice how the device construction now happens within the jitted method.
    # Also note the added '.jax' to the device path.
    dev = qml.device("default.qubit.jax", wires=2, shots=10, prng_key=key)

    # Now we can create our qnode within the circuit function.
    @qml.qnode(dev, interface="jax")
    def my_circuit():
        qml.RX(param, wires=0)
        qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
        return qml.sample(qml.PauliZ(0))
    return my_circuit()

key1 = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)
key2 = jax.random.PRNGKey(1)

# Notice that the first two runs return exactly the same results,
print(f"key1: {circuit(key1, jnp.pi/2)}")
print(f"key1: {circuit(key1, jnp.pi/2)}")

# The second run has different results.

# Closing Remarks
# ----------------
# By now, using JAX with PennyLane should feel very natural. They 
# extend each other very nicely; JAX with it's power transforms, and PennyLane 
# with its easy access to quantum computers. We're still in early days of 
# development, but we hope to continue to grow our ecosystem around JAX,
# and by extension, JAX into quantum computing and quantum machine learning.
#
# The future looks bright for this field, and we're excited to see what you build!

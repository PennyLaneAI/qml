    "In this demo, we'll be implement the FALQON algorithm, standing for *Feedback-based ALgorithm for Quantum Optimization*, introduced by [Magann, Rudinger, Grace & Sarovar (2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08619.pdf). It is similar in spirit to the [QAOA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4028.pdf), but scales with resources differently, using iterative feedback steps rather than a global optimization over parameters. We will show how to implement FALQON in PennyLane and test its performance on the **MaxClique** problem in graph theory!\n",

    "To solve combinatorial optimization problems using a quantum computer, a typical strategy is to encode the solution to the problem as the ground state of *cost Hamiltonian* $H_C$, and choose some strategy to drive the system from a known initial state into this ground state. FALQON falls under this broad scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a quantum system governed by a Hamiltonian of the form $H = H_C + \\beta(t) H_D$. These kinds of Hamiltonians come up quite often in the theory of [quantum control](https://quantiki.org/wiki/quantum-control-theory), which studies how we may go about driving a quantum system from one state to another. The choice of $\\beta(t)$ allows us to decide which state we want a system governed by such a Hamiltonian to evolve towards. \n",

Phrased differently, we would like to minimize the expectation value of $\\langle H_C\\rangle$ (an immediate consequence of the variational principle). Therefore, a reasonable goal is to construct our system such that the expectation decreases with time:\n",

Thus, if we evolve some initial state $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ under the time-evolution operator corresponding to $H$, given by $U(t) = e^{-iHt}$, then we will arrive at the ground state of $H$!

One issue remains: for each step, we need to know the value $\\beta_k$, which are themselves dependent on the state of the system, at some time.

Variational quantum algorithms are seen as one of the most primising candidates
for useful applications of quantum computers in the near term, but there are 
still a few hurdles to overcome when it comes to practical implementation.
One of them, is the trainability. 
In other words, one needs to ensure that the cost function is not flat.
In this tutorial, we will explore the application of perturbative gadgets in 
variational quantum algorithms to outgo the issue of cost-function-dependent
barren plateaus, as proposed in Ref. [#cichy2022]_ 

Some context
------------

Barren plateaus refer to the phenomenon where the gradients of the cost function
decay exponentially with the size of the problem. Essentially, the cost 
landscape becomes flat, with exception of some small regions, e.g., around
the minimum. 
That is a problem because increasing the precision of the cost 
function requires more measurements from the quantum device due to shot noise, 
and an exponential number of measurements would render the algorithm impractical.
If you are not familiar yet with the concept of barren plateaus, I recommend you
first check out the demonstrations on :doc:`barren plateaus </demos/tutorial_barren_plateaus>`
and :doc:`avoiding barren plateaus with local cost functions </demos/tutorial_local_cost_functions>`.

As presented in the second aforementioned demo, barren plateaus are more severe when using global
cost functions compared to local ones. 
A global cost function requires the simultaneous measurement of all
qubits at once. In contrast, a local one is constructed from terms that only 
act on a small subset of qubits.

We want to explore this topic further and learn about one possible mitigation
strategy.  
Thinking about Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) applications, let us consider cost functions that are
expectation values of Hamiltonians such as

.. math:: C(\theta) = \operatorname{Tr} \left[ H V(\theta) |00\ldots 0\rangle \! \langle 00\ldots 0| V(\theta)^\dagger\right].

Here :math:`|00\ldots 0\rangle` is our initial state, 
:math:`V(\theta)` is the circuit ansatz and :math:`H` the Hamiltonian
whose expectation value we need to minimize.
In some cases, it is easy to find a local cost function which can substitute a global one with the same ground state.
Take, for instance, the following Hamiltonians that induce global and local cost functions, respectively.


.. math:: H_G = \mathbb{I} - |00\ldots 0\rangle \! \langle 00\ldots 0| \quad \textrm{ and } \quad H_L = \mathbb{I} - \frac{1}{n} \sum_j |0\rangle \! \langle 0|_j. 

Those are two different Hamiltonians (not just different formulations of the
same one), but they share the same ground state:


.. math:: |\psi_{\textrm{min}} \rangle =  |00\ldots 0\rangle.

Therefore, one can work with either Hamiltonian to perform the VQE routine.
However, it is not always so simple. 
What if we want to find the minimum eigenenergy of 
:math:`H = X \otimes X \otimes Y \otimes Z + Z \otimes Y \otimes X \otimes X` ?  
It is not always trivial to construct a local cost 
function that has the same minimum as the cost function of interest. 
This is where perturbative gadgets come into play!


The definitions
---------------
Perturbative gadgets are a common tool in adiabatic quantum computing. 
Their goal is to find a Hamiltonian with local interactions that mimics
another Hamiltonian with more complex couplings. 

Ideally, they would want to implement the target Hamiltonian with complex couplings, but since it's hard to implement more than few-body interactions on hardware, they cannot do so. Perturbative gadgets work by increasing the dimension of the Hilbert space (i.e., the number
of qubits) and "encoding" the target Hamiltonian in the low-energy 
subspace of a so-called "gadget" Hamiltonian.

Let us now construct such a gadget Hamiltonian tailored for VQE applications.
First, we start from a target Hamiltonian that is a linear combination of 
Pauli words acting on :math:`k` qubits each:

.. math:: H^\text{target} = \sum_i c_i h_i,

where :math:`h_i = \sigma_{i,1} \otimes \sigma_{i,2} \otimes \ldots \otimes \sigma_{i,k}`,
:math:`\sigma_{i,j} \in \{ X, Y, Z \}`, and :math:`c_i \in \mathbb{R}`.  
Now we construct the gadget Hamiltonian.
For each term :math:`h_i`, we will need :math:`k` additional qubits, which we
call auxiliary qubits, and to add two terms to the Hamiltonian:
an "unperturbed" part :math:`H^\text{aux}_i` and a perturbation :math:`V_i` 
of strength :math:`\lambda`. 
The unperturbed part penalizes each of the newly added qubits for not being in 
the :math:`|0\rangle` state

.. math:: H^\text{aux}_i = \sum_{j=1}^k |1\rangle \! \langle 1|_{i,j} = \sum_{j=1}^k \frac{1}{2}(\mathbb{I} - Z_{i,j}).

On the other hand, the perturbation part implements one of the operators in the Pauli word
:math:`\sigma_{i,j}` on the corresponding qubit of the target register and a 
pair of Pauli :math:`X` gates on two of the auxiliary qubits:

.. math:: V_i = \sum_{j=1}^k c_{i,j} \sigma_{i,j} \otimes X_{i,j} \otimes X_{i,(j+1) \mathrm{mod }k}.

In the end, 

.. math:: H^\text{gad} = \sum_{i} \left( H^\text{aux}_i + \lambda V_i \right).



To grasp this idea better, this is what would result from working with a Hamiltonian
acting on a total of :math:`8` qubits and having :math:`3` terms, each of them being a
:math:`4`-body interaction. 

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/barren_gadgets/gadget-terms-tutorial.png
    :align: center
    :width: 90%

For each of the terms :math:`h_1`, :math:`h_2`, and :math:`h_3` we add :math:`4` auxiliary qubits.
In the end, our gadget Hamiltonian acts on :math:`8+3\cdot 4 = 20` qubits.

The penalization (red) acts only on the auxiliary registers, penalizing each 
qubit individually, while the perturbations couple the target with the auxiliary qubits.

As shown in Ref. [#cichy2022]_, this construction results in a spectrum that, for low energies, is similar
to that of the original Hamiltonian. 
This means that by minimizing the gadget Hamiltonian and reaching its global
minimum, the resulting state will be close to the global minimum of 
:math:`H^\text{target}`.

Since it is a local cost function, it is better behaved with respect to 
barren plateaus than the global cost function, making it more trainable.
As a result, one can mitigate the onset of cost-function-dependent barren
plateaus by substituting the global cost function with the resulting gadget
and using that for training instead. That is what we will do in the rest of this tutorial.

# The first 16 elements of our Hamiltonian correspond to the unperturbed part.
# The last 8 are the perturbation. They are a little scrambled, but one can

# Training with the gadget Hamiltonian
# -----------------------------------
# Now that we have a little intuition on how the gadget Hamiltonian construction
# works, we will use it to train.

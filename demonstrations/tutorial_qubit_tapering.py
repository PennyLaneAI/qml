The performance of variational quantum algorithms is considerably limited by the number of qubits
required to represent wave functions. In the context of quantum chemistry, this
limitation hinders the treatment of large molecules with algorithms such as the :doc:`variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE) <tutorial_vqe>`. Several approaches have been developed to reduce the qubit requirements for
quantum chemistry calculations. In this tutorial, we demonstrate the symmetry-based qubit
tapering approach which allows reducing the number of qubits required to perform molecular quantum
simulations based on the :math:`\mathbb{Z}_2` symmetries present in molecular Hamiltonians
[#bravyi2017]_ [#setia2019]_.

A molecular Hamiltonian in the qubit basis can be expressed as a linear combination of Pauli words
as

.. math:: H = \sum_{i=1}^r h_i P_i,

where :math:`h_i` is a real coefficient and :math:`P_i` is a tensor product of Pauli and
identity operators acting on :math:`M` qubits

.. math:: P_i \in \pm \left \{ I, X, Y, Z \right \} ^ {\bigotimes M}.

The main idea in the symmetry-based qubit tapering approach is to find a unitary operator :math:`U`
that transforms :math:`H` to a new Hamiltonian :math:`H'` which has the same eigenvalues as
:math:`H`

.. math:: H' = U^{\dagger} H U = \sum_{i=1}^r c_i \mu_i,

such that each :math:`\mu_i` term in the new Hamiltonian always acts trivially, e.g., with an
identity or a Pauli operator, on a set of qubits. This allows tapering-off those qubits from the
Hamiltonian.

For instance, consider the following Hamiltonian

.. math:: H' = Z_0 X_1 - X_1 + Y_0 X_1,

where all terms in the Hamiltonian act on the second qubit with the :math:`X` operator. It is
straightforward to show that each term in the Hamiltonian commutes with :math:`I_0 X_1` and the
ground-state eigenvector of :math:`H'` is also an eigenvector of :math:`I_0 X_1` with eigenvalues
:math:`\pm 1`. We can also rewrite the Hamiltonian as

.. math:: H' = (Z_0 I_1 - I_0 I_1 + Y_0 I_1) I_0 X_1,

which gives us

.. math:: H'|\psi \rangle = \pm1 (Z_0 I_1 - I_0 I_1 + Y_0 I_1)|\psi \rangle,

where :math:`|\psi \rangle` is an eigenvector of :math:`H'`. This means that the Hamiltonian
:math:`H` can be simplified as

.. math:: H_{tapered} = \pm1 (Z_0 - I_0 + Y_0).

The tapered Hamiltonian :math:`H_{tapered}` has the eigenvalues

.. math:: [-2.41421, 0.41421],

and

.. math::  [2.41421, -0.41421],

depending on the value of the :math:`\pm 1` prefactor. The eigenvalues of the original Hamiltonian
:math:`H` are

.. math:: [2.41421, -2.41421,  0.41421, -0.41421],

which are thus reproduced by the tapered Hamiltonian.

More generally, we can construct the unitary :math:`U` such that each :math:`\mu_i` term acts with a
Pauli-X operator on a set of qubits
:math:`\left \{ j \right \}, j \in \left \{ l, ..., k \right \}` where :math:`j` is the qubit label.
This guarantees that each term of the transformed Hamiltonian commutes with each of the Pauli-X
operators applied to the :math:`j`-th qubit:

.. math:: [H', X^j] = 0,

and the eigenvectors of the transformed Hamiltonian :math:`H'` are also eigenvectors of each of the
:math:`X^{j}` operators. Then we can factor out all of the :math:`X^{j}` operators from the
transformed Hamiltonian and replace them with their eigenvalues :math:`\pm 1`. This gives us a
set of tapered Hamiltonians depending on which eigenvalue :math:`\pm 1` we chose for each of the
:math:`X^{j}` operators. For  instance, in the case of two tapered qubits, we have four eigenvalue
sectors: :math:`[+1, +1]`, :math:`[-1, +1]`, :math:`[+1, -1]`, :math:`[-1, -1]`. In these tapered
Hamiltonians, the set of :math:`\left \{ j \right \}, j \in \left \{ l, ..., k \right \}` qubits
are eliminated. For tapered molecular Hamiltonians, it is possible to determine the optimal sector
of the eigenvalues that corresponds to the ground state. This is explained in more detail in the
following sections.

The unitary operator :math:`U` can be constructed as a
`Clifford <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_gates>`__ operator [#bravyi2017]_

.. math:: U = \Pi_j \left [\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left (X^{q(j)} + \tau_j \right) \right],

where :math:`\tau` denotes the generators of the symmetry group of :math:`H` and
:math:`X^{q}` operators act on those qubits that will be ultimately tapered off from
the Hamiltonian. The symmetry group of the Hamiltonian is defined as an Abelian group of Pauli words that commute
with each term in the Hamiltonian (excluding :math:`âˆ’I`). The
`generators <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_set_of_a_group>`__ of the symmetry group are
those elements of the group that can be combined, along with their inverses, to create any other
member of the group.

Let's use the qubit tapering method and obtain the ground state energy of the `Helium hydride
cation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium_hydride_ion>`__ :math:`\textrm{HeH}^+`.

Tapering the molecular Hamiltonian

In PennyLane, a :doc:`molecular Hamiltonian <tutorial_quantum_chemistry>` can be created by specifying the atomic symbols and
coordinates.

# Conclusions

# Molecular Hamiltonians possess symmetries that can be leveraged to reduce the number of qubits

# obtaining tapered Hamiltonians and tapered reference states that can be used in variational
# quantum algorithms such as VQE.

Implicit differentiation can be used to compute gradients of a function that
cannot be written down explicitly using simple elementary operations. In this
notebook we use the idea of implicit differentiation to compute gradients
through a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) that finds ground-state solutions to
a parameterized Hamiltonian :math:`H(a)` using a variational state :math:`|\psi_{z}\rangle`
such that

.. math::

    z^{*}(a) = \arg\,\min_{z} \langle \psi_{z}|H(a)|\psi_z\rangle.

We are interested in computing the gradient :math:`\partial_a z^{*}(a)`. This will 
allow us to compute other quantities that depend on this gradient such
as a generalized susceptibility,

.. math::

    \partial_a \langle A \rangle = \partial_a \langle \psi_{z^{*}(a)} | A |\psi_{z^{*}(a)} \rangle.

Since a brute-force application of automatic differentiation through the full
optimization task would require keeping track of all intermediate variables and
steps, it could be computationally expensive.

Implicit differentiation provides a way to efficiently compute gradients
through such problems. In this tutorial, we will compute implicit
gradients through a variational algorithm written in PennyLane using the
modular implicit differentiation tool JAXOpt.

Implicit Differentiation
------------------------

We consider differentiating the solution of an optimization problem :math:`z^{*}(a)`
given by

.. math::

    z^{*}(a) = \arg\,\min_{z} g(z, a).

We may not have an explicit analytical solution for :math:`z^{*}(a)` to
differentiate and obtain :math:`\partial_a z^{*}(a)`. However, some iterative
algorithm could compute the solution starting from an initial set of values
for :math:`z`, e.g., using gradient-based optimization of the function 
:math:`g(z, a)`. A brute-force application of automatic differentiation through
the full optimization algorithm would require keeping track of all the steps 
in the optimization. This can quickly make computing gradients become 
very memory intensive. Implicit differentiation can
compute :math:`\partial_a z^{*}(a)` more efficiently than brute-force automatic
differentiation, using only the solution :math:`z^{*}(a)` 
and partial derivatives at the solution point.

The main idea is that for some analytic function :math:`f(z, a)`, if in some
local neighbourhood around :math:`(z_0, a_0)` we have :math:`f(z_0, a_0) = 0`
(points marked by the red stars below), there exists an analytic solution
:math:`z^{*}(a)` (red line) that satisfies :math:`f(z^{*}(a), a) = 0`.
    
    
.. figure:: ../demonstrations/implicit_diff/implicit_diff.png
   :scale: 65%
   :alt: circles

Since the solution function is analytic, it can be
differentiated at :math:`(z_0, a_0)` simply by differentiating the above equation
with respect to :math:`a` as,

.. math::
    
    \partial_a f(z_0, a_0) + \partial_{z} f(z_0, a_0) \partial_{a} z^{*}(a) &=& 0 \\

    \partial_{a} z^{*}(a) &=& - (\partial_{z} f(z_0, a_0) )^{-1}\partial_a f(z_0, a_0)


Therefore we need to find a so-called optimality condition (or fixed-point equation)
that can be solved. In case of optimization tasks, such an optimality condition
would be that at the minima, the gradient of the cost function is zero,

.. math::

    f(z, a) = \partial_z g(z, a) = 0.

Then, as long as we have the solution :math:`z^{*}(a)`, and the partial derivatives 
:math:`(\partial_a f, \partial_z f)` at the solution (here the Hessian of the cost function :math:`g(z, a)`), 
we can compute implicit gradients. Note that for a multivariate function that inversion
:math:`(\partial_{z} f(z_0, a_0) )^{-1}` needs to be defined and easy to
compute. It is possible to approximate this inversion in a clever way by constructing
a linear problem that can be solved approximately; [1] [2].


Implicit differentiation through a variational quantum algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us take a parameterized Hamiltonian :math:`H(a)`, where :math:`a` is a parameter that can
be continuously varied. If :math:`\psi_{z}` is a variational solution
to the ground state of :math:`H(a)`, then we can find a :math:`z^*(a)` that minimizes the ground
state energy, i.e.,

.. math::
    
    z^*(a) = \argmin_{z} \langle \psi_{z}| H(a) | \psi_{z}\rangle = \argmin_{z} E(z, a)


where :math:`E(z, a)` is the energy function. We consider the following Hamiltonian

.. math::
    
    H(a) = -J \sum_{i}^{N-1} \sigma^{z}_i \sigma^{z}_{i+1} - \gamma \sum_{i}^{N} \sigma^{x}_i - a H_1 + \delta \sum_i \sigma^z_i,


where :math:`J` is the interaction, :math:`\sigma_{x, z}` are the spin-:math:`\frac{1}{2}` operators, 
:math:`\gamma` is the magnetic field strength (which is taken to be the same for all spins).
The term :math:`H_1 = M = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i^{i=N} \sigma^{z}_i` is the magnetization and a small non-zero 
magnetization :math:`\delta \sum_i \sigma^z_i` is added for numerical stability.
We have assumed a circular chain such that in the interaction term the last spin
(:math:`i=N-1`) interacts with the first (:math:`i=0`). 

Now we could find the ground state of this Hamiltonian simply by taking the 
eigendecomposition and applying automatic differentiation through the 
eigendecomposition to compute gradients.
We will compare this exact computation for a small system to the gradients given
by implicit differentiation through a variationally obtained solution.

We define the following optimality condition at the solution point:

.. math::
    
    f(z, a) = \nabla_z E(z, a) = 0.


In addition, if the conditions of the implicit function theorem
are also satisfied, i.e., :math:`f` is continuously differentiable
with non-singular Jacobian at the solution, then we can apply chain rule
and determine the implicit gradients easily.

Now, any other complicated function that depends on the variational ground state
can be easily differentiated using automatic differentiation through the argmin
solver. If :math:`A` is an operator, then its expectation value for the ground state
is

.. math::
    
    \langle A\rangle = \langle \psi_{z^*}| A| \psi_{z*}\rangle.

The quantity :math:`\partial_{a} \langle A\rangle` is called *generalized susceptibility*. 
In a similar way, we can now take implicit gradients through
any variational quantum algorithm and compute interesting quantities that
are written as gradients with respect to the ground state, e.g., nuclear forces in
quantum chemistry, permanent electric dipolestatic polarizability,
the static hyperpolarizabilities of various orders, generalized susceptibilities,
fidelity susceptibilities, and geometric tensors.

r"""Intro to Quantum Phase Estimation
=============================================================

The Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm is one of the most important tools in quantum
computing. Maybe THE most important. It solves a straightforward task: given an eigentate of a
unitary operator, find its eigenvalue. Innocent as it may seem, being able to efficiently solve this problem has vast
consequences. It elegantly captures many of the core principles that make quantum computing unique.

This demo explains the basics of the QPE algorithm. After reading it, you will be able to understand the essence of QPE
and how to implement it in PennyLane.

The QPE algorithm
-----------------

Let's begin by more carefully definining the problem. We are given a unitary
operator :math:`U` and one of its eigenstates :math:`|\psi \rangle`. We assume that we can prepare this
eigenstate exactly on a quantum computer (we'll relax that assumption later). Since the operator is unitary, we
know that:

.. math::
    U |\psi \rangle = e^{i \theta} |\psi \rangle,

where :math:`\theta` is the *phase* of the eigenvalue. The goal is to estimate :math:`\theta`
(hence the name phase estimation). Our challenge is to design a quantum algorithm to solve this problem.
How would that work?


**Part 1**
We could solve the problem by finding a quantum circuit performing the transformation

.. math::
    |\psi \rangle |0\rangle \rightarrow  |\psi \rangle |\theta\rangle,

since by measuring the second register we obtain :math:`\theta` directly. We refer to the first register as the system,
and the second as the estimation register.

Let's be a bit more careful. Because the
complex exponential has period :math:`2\pi`, technically the phase is not unique. So instead we
define :math:`\theta = 2\pi \phi` so that :math:`\phi` is a number between 0 and 1, enforcing :math:`\theta` to be between
0 and :math:`2\pi`. We'll refer to :math:`\phi` as the phase from now on.

How can we encode :math:`\phi` on a quantum computer? The answer is the first clever part of the algorithm: we represent
:math:`\phi` in binary. But since you probably don't use binary fractions on a daily basis, it's worth stopping for a moment
to make sure we're on the same page.

.. note::
    **Binary fractions**

    When we write a number like 0.15625, it is actually being expressed as a weighted sum of powers of
    10 ðŸ¤¯:

    .. math::
        0.15625 = 1*10^{-1} + 5*10^{-2} + 6*10^{-3} + 2*10^{-4} +  5*10^{-5}.

    Nothing is stopping us from doing the same with 2 instead of 10. In binary, the same number is

    .. math::
        0.00101 = 0*2^{-1} + 0*2^{-2} + 1*2^{-3} + 0*2^{-4} +  1*2^{-5}.

    (You can confirm by computing 1/8 + 1/32). Similarly, 0.5 in decimal is 0.1 in binary, and 0.3125 is 0.0101. ðŸ§ 
    If you're having fun: how would you write 0.111 in decimal?

Ok, now back to quantum. A binary representation is useful because we can easily encode it using
qubits, keeping track only of the digits to the right of the point, e.g., :math:`|110010\rangle` for
:math:`\phi=0.110010`. The phase is retrieved by measuring the qubits. The *precision* is determined by the number of
qubits. We've used examples of fractions that can be expressed exactly with just a few binary points, but this won't
always be possible. Remember this for later. From now on, we'll use :math:`n` for the number of estimation qubits.

**Part 2**

The second clever part of the algorithm is to follow an advice given to many physicists:
"When in doubt, take the Fourier transform"; or in our case, "When in doubt, take the quantum Fourier transform (QFT)".

.. math::
   \text{QFT}|\phi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}\sum_{k=0} e^{i\phi k} |k\rangle.

We then look for a circuit performing the transformation

.. math::
    |\psi \rangle |0\rangle \rightarrow  |\psi \rangle \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}\sum_{k=0} e^{i2\pi \phi k} |k\rangle.

If we can do this, then applying the *inverse* QFT would prepare :math:`|\phi\rangle` in the estimation register.
This looks more promising, especially if we notice the appearance of the eigenvalues :math:`e^{i\phi}` (although with an extra factor
of :math`k` ðŸ¤”). Are you thinking what we're thinking? We can get that extra factor by applying the unitary :math`k` times:

.. math::
   U^k|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}\sum_{k=0} e^{i2\pi\phi k} |k\rangle.

Moreover, the sum is just an equal superposition over the estimation qubits. So if we could find a circuit that
performs the transformation

.. math::
   |\psi\rangle |k\rangle=  U^k |\psi\rangle |k\rangle,

we could (i) apply a Hadamrd gate on all estimation qubits, (ii) apply the circuit in the equation above,
(iii) perform the inverse QFT, and (iv) measure the estimation qubits to retrieve the phase. Almost there!

**Part 3**

We follow another timeless physics advice: "If stuck, start with the simplest case".
Isn't it great to be a physicist? Simple for us means just one estimation qubit. After applying a Hadamard, the circuit we need is

.. math::
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |\psi\rangle |0\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |\psi\rangle |1\rangle \rightarrow
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |\psi\rangle |0\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} U|\psi\rangle |1\rangle.

We know how to do this: it's just a controlled-U operation. What about two qubits? Ommiting normalization factors, we need
the circuit

.. math::
   \psi\rangle |00\rangle + |\psi\rangle |01\rangle + |\psi\rangle |10\rangle+  |\psi\rangle |11\rangle\rightarrow
   \psi\rangle |00\rangle + |\psi\rangle U|01\rangle + |\psi\rangle U^2|10\rangle+ |\psi\rangle U^3|11\rangle\rightarrow.

Notice something? This is just applying :math:`\psi\rangle |k\rangle \rightarrow \psi U^k\rangle |k\rangle` with
:math:`k` expressed in binary, which we can implement by applying :math:`U` controlled on the first qubit, and
:math:`U^2` controlled on the second qubit. With six qubits an example would be

.. math::
   \psi\rangle |010111\rangle \rightarrow U^1U^2U^4U^{16}\psi\rangle |010110\rangle = U^{23}\psi\rangle |010111\rangle.

(Note that 010111 is 23 in binary.) So we have the answer: apply :math:`U^m` controlled on the `m`-th estimation qubit.
In PennyLane we refer to this circuit as a :class:`~.ControlledSequence` operation.

Bringing it all together, here is the quantum phase estimation algorithm in all its glory:

**QPE algorithm**

1. Start with the state :math:`|\psi \rangle |0\rangle`. Apply a Hadmard gate to all estimation qubits to implement the
   transformation
   .. math::
       |\psi \rangle |0\rangle \rightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}\sum_{k=0} |\psi\rangle|k\rangle.

2. Apply a :class:`~.ControlledSequence` operation, i.e., apply :math:`U^m` controlled on the `m`-th estimation qubit.
   This gives
   .. math::
       \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}\sum_{k=0} |\psi\rangle|k\rangle \rightarrow  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}\sum_{k=0} e^{i2\pi \phi k}|\psi\rangle|k\rangle.

3. Apply the inverse quantum Fourier transform to the estimation qubits to obtain
    .. math::
       \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}\sum_{k=0} e^{i2\pi \phi k}|\psi\rangle|k\rangle \rightarrow |\psi\rangle|\phi\rangle.

4. Measure the estimation qubits to recover :math:`\phi`.

Notice that most of the heavy lifting is done by the controlled sequence step. Control-U operations are the heart of the algorithm,
coupled with a clever use of Fourier transforms. Overall, we recognize three main ingredients: (i) creating a
superposition state over the estimation qbits, (ii) controlled sequence, (iii) Fourier transform. PennyLane
implements QPE and its many variants by treating each of these separately, allowing you to experiment with multiple
possibilities.

If you think about it, QPE is doing something incredible: it can calculate eigenvalues **without ever diagonalizing
a matrix**. This is true even if we relax the assumption that the input is an eigenstate. By linearity, for an arbitray
state expanded in the eigenbasis of :math:`U` as

.. math::
   \Psi\rangle = \sum_i c_i |\psi_i\rangle,

QPE outputs the phase :math:`\phi_i` with probability :math:`|c_i|^2. This feature is crucial for quantum chemistry applications,
where preparing good initial states is essential [link to demo and paper].

A final point of importance. Generally it is not possible to represent a given phase exactly using a limited number of
estimation qubits. Thus, even if the input is an exact eigenstate, there is typically a distribution of possible
outcomes, which induce an error in the estimation. We'll see an example in the code below.
The error *decreases* exponentially with the number of estimation qubits, but the number of controlled-U operations
*increases* exponentially. The math is such that these effects essentially cancel out and the cost of estimating a phase
with error :math:`\varepsilon` scales as :math:`1/\varepsilon`. This is called *Heisenberg-limited* error,
and it is the best error scaling possible.

# Conclusion
# ----------
# This demo presented the "textbook" version of QPE. There are multiple variations, notably iterative QPE that
# uses a single estimation qubit, as well as Bayesian versions of QPE that saturate optimal prefactors appearing in the
# total cost. There are also more mathematical subtleties about cost and errors that are important but outside of
# scope for this demo.
#
# Finally, there is extensive work on how to implement the main unitaries, and how to choose them wisely for
# applicaions. For example, in quantum chemistry, the main strategy is to find methods to encode a molecular Hamiltonian
# into a unitary such that the phases are invertible functions of the Hamiltonian eigenvalues. This can be done for instance
# through the mapping :math:`e^{-iH }`, which can be implemented using Hamiltonian simulation techniques. QPE can then
# be used to sample eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian with respect to a distribution induced by the input state. This is a
# feature that cannot be done efficiently with classical computers.

# This demonstration investigates quantum graph
# recurrent neural networks (QGRNN), which are the quantum analogue of a
# classical graph recurrent neural network, and a subclass of the more
# general quantum graph
# neural network ansatz. Both the QGNN and QGRNN were introduced in
# `this paper (2019) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12264>`__.

# The Idea
# --------
#


######################################################################
# A graph is defined as a set of *nodes* along with a set of
# **edges**, which represent connections between nodes.
# Information can be encoded into graphs by assigning numbers
# to nodes and edges, which we call **weights**.
# It is usually convenient to think of a graph visually:
#
# .. image:: ../demonstrations/qgrnn/graph.png
#     :width: 70%
#     :align: center
#
# In recent years, the concept of a
# `graph neural network <https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08434>`__ (GNN) has been
# receiving a lot of attention from the machine learning community.
# A GNN seeks
# to learn a representation (a mapping of data into a
# low-dimensional vector space) of a given graph with feature vectors assigned
# to nodes and edges. Each of the vectors in the learned
# representation preserves not only the features, but also the overall
# topology of the graph, i.e., which nodes are connected by edges. The
# quantum graph neural network attempts to do something similar, but for
# features that are quantum-mechanical; for instance, a
# collection of quantum states.
#


######################################################################
# Consider the class of qubit Hamiltonians that are *quadratic*, meaning that
# the terms of the Hamiltonian represent either interactions between two
# qubits, or the energy of individual qubits.
# This class of Hamiltonians is naturally described by graphs, with
# second-order terms between qubits corresponding to weighted edges between
# nodes, and first-order terms corresponding to node weights.
#
# A well known example of a quadratic Hamiltonian is the transverse-field
# Ising model, which is defined as
#
# .. math::
#
#     \hat{H}_{\text{Ising}}(\boldsymbol\theta) \ = \ \displaystyle\sum_{(i, j) \in E}
#     \theta_{ij}^{(1)} Z_{i} Z_{j} \ + \ \displaystyle\sum_{i} \theta_{i}^{(2)} Z_{i} \ + \
#     \displaystyle\sum_{i} X_{i},
#
# where :math:`\boldsymbol\theta \ = \ \{\theta^{(1)}, \ \theta^{(2)}\}`.
# In this Hamiltonian, the set :math:`E` that determines which pairs of qubits
# have :math:`ZZ` interactions can be represented by the set of edges for some graph. With
# the qubits as nodes, this graph is called the *interaction graph*.
# The :math:`\theta^{(1)}` parameters correspond to the edge weights and
# the :math:`\theta^{(2)}`
# parameters correspond to weights on the nodes.
#


######################################################################
# This result implies that we can think about *quantum circuits* with
# graph-theoretic properties. Recall that the time-evolution operator
# with respect to some Hamiltonian :math:`H` is defined as:
#
# .. math:: U \ = \ e^{-it H}.
#
# Thus, we have a clean way of taking quadratic Hamiltonians and turning
# them into unitaries (quantum circuits) that preserve the same correspondance to a graph.
# In the case of the Ising Hamiltonian, we have:
#
# .. math::
#
#     U_{\text{Ising}} \ = \ e^{-it \hat{H}_{\text{Ising}} (\boldsymbol\theta)} \ = \ \exp \Big[ -it
#     \Big( \displaystyle\sum_{(i, j) \in E} \theta_{ij}^{(1)} Z_{i} Z_{j} \ + \
#     \displaystyle\sum_{i} \theta_{i}^{(2)} Z_{i} \ + \ \displaystyle\sum_{i} X_{i} \Big) \Big]
#
# In general, this kind of unitary is very difficult to implement on a quantum computer.
# However, we can approximate it using the `Trotter-Suzuki decomposition
# <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-evolving_block_decimation#The_Suzuki-Trotter_expansion>`__:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \exp \Big[ -it \Big( \displaystyle\sum_{(i, j) \in E} \theta_{ij}^{(1)} Z_{i} Z_{j} \ + \
#     \displaystyle\sum_{i} \theta_{i}^{(2)} Z_{i} \ + \ \displaystyle\sum_{i} X_{i} \Big) \Big]
#     \ \approx \ \displaystyle\prod_{k \ = \ 1}^{t / \Delta} \Bigg[ \displaystyle\prod_{j \ = \
#     1}^{Q} e^{-i \Delta \hat{H}_{\text{Ising}}^{j}(\boldsymbol\theta)} \Bigg]
#
# where :math:`\hat{H}_{\text{Ising}}^{j}(\boldsymbol\theta)` is the :math:`j`-th term of the
# Ising Hamiltonian and :math:`\Delta` is some small number.
#
# This circuit is a specific instance of the **Quantum Graph
# Recurrent Neural Network**, which in general is defined as a variational ansatz of
# the form
#
# .. math::
#
#     U_{H}(\boldsymbol\mu, \ \boldsymbol\gamma) \ = \ \displaystyle\prod_{i \ = \ 1}^{P} \Bigg[
#     \displaystyle\prod_{j \ = \ 1}^{Q} e^{-i \gamma_j H^{j}(\boldsymbol\mu)} \Bigg],
#
# for some parametrized quadratic Hamiltonian, :math:`H(\boldsymbol\mu)`.

# Using the QGRNN
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#

######################################################################
# Since the QGRNN ansatz is equivalent to the
# approximate time evolution of some quadratic Hamiltonian, we can use it
# to learn the dynamics of a quantum system.
#
# Continuing with the Ising model example, let's imagine we have some system
# governed by :math:`\hat{H}_{\text{Ising}}(\boldsymbol\alpha)` for an unknown set of
# target parameters,
# :math:`\boldsymbol\alpha` and an unknown interaction graph :math:`G`. Let's also
# suppose we have access to copies of some
# low-energy, non-ground state of the target Hamiltonian, :math:`|\psi_0\rangle`. In addition,
# we have access to a collection of time-evolved states,
# :math:`\{ |\psi(t_1)\rangle, \ |\psi(t_2)\rangle, \ ..., \ |\psi(t_N)\rangle \}`, defined by:
#
# .. math:: |\psi(t_k)\rangle \ = \ e^{-i t_k \hat{H}_{\text{Ising}}(\boldsymbol\alpha)} |\psi_0\rangle.
#
# We call the low-energy states and the collection of time-evolved states *quantum data*.
# From here, we randomly pick a number of time-evolved states
# from our collection. For any state that we choose, which is
# evolved to some time :math:`t_k`, we compare it
# to
#
# .. math::
#
#     U_{\hat{H}_{\text{Ising}}}(\boldsymbol\mu, \ \Delta) |\psi_0\rangle \ \approx \ e^{-i t_k
#     \hat{H}_{\text{Ising}}(\boldsymbol\mu)} |\psi_0\rangle.
#
# This is done by feeding one of the copies of :math:`|\psi_0\rangle` into a quantum circuit
# with the QGRNN ansatz, with some guessed set of parameters :math:`\boldsymbol\mu`
# and a guessed interaction graph, :math:`G'`.
# We then use a classical optimizer to maximize the average
# "similarity" between the time-evolved states and the states prepared
# with the QGRNN.
#
# As the QGRNN states becomes more similar to
# each time-evolved state for each sampled time, it follows that
# :math:`\boldsymbol\mu \ \rightarrow \ \boldsymbol\alpha`
# and we are able to learn the unknown parameters of the Hamiltonian.

# Learning an Ising Model with the QGRNN
# ---------------------------------------
#


######################################################################
# We now attempt to use the QGRNN to learn the parameters corresponding
# to an arbitrary transverse-field Ising model Hamiltonian.
#


######################################################################
# Getting Started
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#


######################################################################
# We begin by importing the necessary dependencies:
#


import pennylane as qml
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from pennylane import numpy as np
import scipy
import networkx as nx
import copy


######################################################################
# We also define some fixed values that are used throughout
# the simulation.
#


qubit_number = 4
qubits = range(qubit_number)


######################################################################
# In this
# simulation, we don't have quantum data readily available to pass into
# the QGRNN, so we have to generate it ourselves. To do this, we must
# have knowledge of the target interaction graph and the target Hamiltonian.
#
# Let us use the following cyclic graph as the target interaction graph
# of the Ising Hamiltonian:
#


ising_graph = nx.cycle_graph(qubit_number)

print(f"Edges: {ising_graph.edges}")
nx.draw(ising_graph)



######################################################################
# We can then initialize the “unknown” target parameters that describe the
# target Hamiltonian, :math:`\boldsymbol\alpha \ = \ \{\alpha^{(1)}, \ \alpha^{(2)}\}`.
# Recall from the introduction that we have defined our parametrized
# Ising Hamiltonian to be of the form:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \hat{H}_{\text{Ising}}(\boldsymbol\theta) \ = \ \displaystyle\sum_{(i, j) \in E}
#     \theta_{ij}^{(1)} Z_{i} Z_{j} \ + \ \displaystyle\sum_{i} \theta_{i}^{(2)} Z_{i} \ + \
#     \displaystyle\sum_{i} X_{i},
#
# where :math:`E` is the set of edges in the interaction graph, and
# :math:`X_i` and :math:`Z_i` are the Pauli-X and Pauli-Z on the
# :math:`i`-th qubit.
#
# For this tutorial, we choose the target parameters by sampling from
# a uniform probability distribution ranging from :math:`-2` to :math:`2`, with
# two-decimal precision.
#

target_weights = [0.56, 1.24, 1.67, -0.79]

######################################################################
# In theory, these parameters can
# be any value we want, provided they are reasonably small enough that the QGRNN can reach them
# in a tractable number of optimization steps.
# In ``matrix_params``, the first list represents the :math:`ZZ` interaction parameters and
# the second list represents the single-qubit :math:`Z` parameters.
#
# Finally,
# we use this information to generate the matrix form of the
# Ising model Hamiltonian in the computational basis:

# This state can be obtained by using a decoupled version of the
# :doc:`Variational Quantum Eigensolver </demos/tutorial_vqe>` algorithm (VQE).
# Essentially, we choose a
# VQE ansatz such that the circuit cannot learn the exact ground state,
# but it can get fairly close. Another way to arrive at the same result is
# to perform VQE with a reasonable ansatz, but to terminate the algorithm
# before it converges to the ground state. If we used the exact ground state
# :math:`|\psi_0\rangle`, the time-dependence would be trivial and the
# data would not provide enough information about the Hamiltonian parameters.

# Learning the Hamiltonian
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#


######################################################################

# Hamiltonians in the QGRNN ansatz,
# :math:`\hat{H}^{j}_{\text{Ising}}(\boldsymbol\mu)`, are the
# :math:`ZZ`, :math:`Z`, and :math:`X` terms from the Ising
# Hamiltonian. This gives:

######################################################################
# As was mentioned in the first section, the QGRNN has two
# registers. In one register, some piece of quantum data
# :math:`|\psi(t)\rangle` is prepared and in the other we have
# :math:`U_{H}(\boldsymbol\mu, \ \Delta) |\psi_0\rangle`. We need a
# way to measure the similarity between these states.
# This can be done by using the fidelity, which is
# simply the modulus squared of the inner product between the states,
# :math:`| \langle \psi(t) | U_{H}(\Delta, \ \boldsymbol\mu) |\psi_0\rangle |^2`.
# To calculate this value, we use a `SWAP
# test <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap_test>`__ between the registers:
#

    qml.Hadamard(wires=control)

######################################################################
# After performing this procedure, the value returned from a measurement of the circuit is
# :math:`\langle Z \rangle`, with respect to the ``control`` qubit.
# The probability of measuring the :math:`|0\rangle` state
# in this control qubit is related to both the fidelity
# between registers and :math:`\langle Z \rangle`. Thus, with a bit of algebra,
# we find that :math:`\langle Z \rangle` is equal to the fidelity.
#
# Before creating the full QGRNN and the cost function, we
# define a few more fixed values. Among these is a "guessed"
# interaction graph, which we set to be a
# `complete graph <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph>`__. This choice is
# motivated by the fact that any target interaction graph will be a subgraph
# of this initial guess. Part of the idea behind the QGRNN is that
# we don’t know the interaction graph, and it has to be learned. In this case, the graph
# is learned *automatically* as the target parameters are optimized. The
# :math:`\boldsymbol\mu` parameters that correspond to edges that don't exist in
# the target graph will simply approach :math:`0`.

######################################################################
# We have the full QGRNN circuit, but we still need to define a cost function.
# We know that
# :math:`| \langle \psi(t) | U_{H}(\boldsymbol\mu, \ \Delta) |\psi_0\rangle |^2`

# The weights of edges :math:`(1, 3)` and :math:`(2, 0)`
# are very close to :math:`0`, indicating we have learned the cycle graph
# from the complete graph. In addition, the remaining learned weights
# are fairly close to those of the target Hamiltonian.
# Thus, the QGRNN is functioning properly, and has learned the target
# Ising Hamiltonian to a high
# degree of accuracy!

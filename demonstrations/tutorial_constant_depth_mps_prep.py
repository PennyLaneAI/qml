r"""Constant-depth preparation of matrix product states with dynamic circuits
=============================================================================

Matrix product states (MPS) are used in a plethora of applications on quantum
many-body systems, both on classical and quantum computers.
This makes the preparation of MPS on a quantum computer an important subroutine,
for example when warm-starting a quantum algorithm with a classically optimized
MPS or preparing initial states with well-studied physical properties.

In this demo you will learn to prepare certain MPS with a dynamic
quantum circuit of constant depth. We will implement the circuit, which makes use
of mid-circuit measurements and conditionally applied operations, for a specific
MPS. Then we will compare it to a (static) sequential circuit with linear depth.
Throughout, we closely follow the similarly titled article by Smith et al. [#smith]_.

.. note::

    If you are new to dynamic circuit tools (mid-circuit measurements and classically
    controlled operations) used in this algorithm, we recommend to check out
    our :doc:`introduction to mid-circuit measurements
    </demos/tutorial_mcm_introduction>` and learn
    :doc:`how to create dynamic circuits with mid-circuit measurements
    </demos/tutorial_how_to_create_dynamic_mcm_circuits>`.

    Optionally, you may want to familiarize yourself with tensor network states
    and MPS in particular. For this, take a look at our demos on
    :doc:`tensor-network quantum circuits </demos/tutorial_tn_circuits>` and
    :doc:`initial state preparation for quantum chemistry
    </demos/tutorial_initial_state_preparation>`, which uses a prepared MPS in
    an application.

Outline
-------

We will start by briefly (no, really!) introducing the building blocks for
the algorithm from a mathematical perspective. One of these blocks
will be the sequential MPS preparation circuit to which we will compare later.
Alongside this introduction we will describe and code up each building block for a
specific MPS. Then we will combine the building blocks into the constant-depth
algorithm by Smith et al. and will run it for the example MPS.
As a preview, this is a schematic overview of the algorithm:

    :align: center

We will get to all these steps in detail below, but in short, the algorithm
runs through five steps. It (1) creates independent MPS on small groups of qubits
and then (2) fuses them together with mid-circuit measurements. This leaves
the overall state with some defects, which are (3) corrected and moved to the
boundary of the state with dynamic operations and classical processing.
Then, all that is left to do is to (4) correct the defect at the boundary and
finally (5) to measure two remaining bond qudits projectively.

Building blocks of the algorithm
--------------------------------

We briefly introduce MPS and a sequential circuit with linear
depth to prepare them, as well as two tools from quantum information theory
that we will use below: fusion of MPS with mid-circuit measurements
and *operator pushing*.

Matrix product states (MPS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Matrix product states (MPS) are an important class of quantum states.
They can be described and manipulated conveniently on classical computers and
are able to approximate relevant states in quantum many-body systems.
In particular, MPS can efficiently describe ground states of (gapped local)
one-dimensional Hamiltonians, which in addition can be found efficiently using
density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithms.
Also check out our :doc:`introduction to matrix product states </demos/tutorial_mps>`,
and see [#schollwoeck]_ for a review of MPS.

Following [#smith]_, we will look at translation-invariant MPS
of a quantum :math:`N`-body system where each body, or site, has local (physical)
dimension :math:`d.` We will further restrict to periodic boundary conditions,
corresponding to translational invariance of the MPS on a closed loop.
A general MPS with these properties is given by

.. math::

    |\Psi\rangle = \sum_{\vec{m}} \operatorname{tr}[A^{m_1}A^{m_2}\cdots A^{m_N}]|\vec{m}\rangle,

where :math:`\vec{m}` is a multi-index of :math:`N` indices ranging over :math:`d,`
i.e., :math:`\vec{m}\in\{0, 1 \dots, d-1\}^N,` and :math:`\{A^{m}\}_{m}` are :math:`d`
square matrices of equal dimension :math:`D.` (Note that we are using the same
:math:`A^m` for each physical site, due to the translational invariance.)
This dimension :math:`D` is called the bond dimension,
which is a crucial quantity for the expressivity and complexity of the MPS.
We see that :math:`|\Psi\rangle` is fully specified by the :math:`d\times D\times D=dD^2`
numbers in the rank-3 tensor :math:`A.`
However, this specification is not unique. We remove some of the redundancies by assuming
that :math:`A` is in so-called left-canonical form, meaning that it satisfies

.. math::

    \sum_m {A^m}^\dagger A^m = \mathbb{I}.

We will not discuss additional redundancies here but refer to [#smith]_ and the
mentioned reviews for more details.

**Example**

As an example, consider a chain of :math:`N` qubits :math:`(d=2)` and an MPS
:math:`|\Psi(g)\rangle` on this system with :math:`D=2,` defined by the matrices

.. math::

    A^0 = \eta \left(\begin{matrix} 1 & 0 \\ \sqrt{-g} & 0 \end{matrix}\right);
    \quad
    A^1 = \eta \left(\begin{matrix} 0 & -\sqrt{-g} \\ 0 & 1 \end{matrix}\right),

where :math:`\eta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-g}}` and :math:`g\in[-1, 0]` is a freely chosen parameter.

This MPS is a simple yet important example (also discussed in Sec. III C 1. of [#smith]_)
because it can be tuned from the GHZ state
:math:`|\Psi(0)\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle^{\otimes N} + |1\rangle^{\otimes N})`
to the product state :math:`|\Psi(-1)\rangle=|+\rangle^{\otimes N},` two states that differ
greatly in their physical properties.

One such property is the correlation length.
For the GHZ state, a correlator between sites :math:`0` and :math:`j` is

.. math::

    C_{\text{GHZ}}(j) = \langle Z(0) Z(j) \rangle_{\text{GHZ}} - \langle Z(0)\rangle_{\text{GHZ}}\langle Z(j)\rangle_{\text{GHZ}} = 1.

That is, the correlation does not decay with the distance :math:`j,` but the correlation length is
infinite. For the product state, on the other hand, we get

.. math::

    C_{+}(j) = \langle Z(0) Z(j) \rangle_{+} - \langle Z(0)\rangle_{+}\langle Z(j)\rangle_{+} = 0,

so that correlations decay "instantaneously." The correlation length vanishes.
Long-range correlated states require linear-depth circuits if we are restricted to unitary
operations. Therefore, the constant-depth circuit for :math:`|\Psi(0)\rangle` will demonstrate
that dynamic quantum circuits, which are not purely unitary, are more powerful than unitary
operations alone!

The MPS :math:`|\Psi(g)\rangle` will be our running example throughout this demo.
To warm up our coding, let's define the tensor :math:`A` and test that it is in left-canonical form.

# Sequential preparation circuit
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# An MPS like the one above can be prepared in linear depth using an established technique
# by Sch√∂n et al. [#schoen]_. We introduce this technique here because the new
# constant-depth construction uses it as a (parallelized) subroutine, and because we will
# later compare the two approaches.
#
# The MPS :math:`|\Psi\rangle` above is given by the rank-3 tensor :math:`A.`
# We can think of this as an operator that acts on a bond site and simultaneously *creates*
# a physical site. However, a unitary quantum circuit is not allowed to
# create qudits out of nowhere. To fix this, we construct a unitary operation
# from :math:`A` that already takes a physical site as input.
# This means that we build a new rank-4 tensor :math:`U` with an additional
# axis of dimension :math:`d.` Then we demand that :math:`U` acts like :math:`A` if this
# new physical input axis is in the state :math:`|0\rangle.` That is, after applying :math:`U`
# to a physical site in :math:`|0\rangle` and a bond site, we obtain the same result as
# applying :math:`A` to the bond site alone.
#
# We leave the action of :math:`U` on other physical input states undefined, and only require
# it to make :math:`U` unitary overall.
# In short, our construction can be written as
#
# .. math::
#
#     U = \sum_m A^m \otimes |m\rangle\!\langle 0| + C_\perp,
#
# where :math:`C_\perp` can be any operator making :math:`U` unitary.
#
# In the definition of the MPS, the bond site is passed on between copies of :math:`A,`
# sequentially creating physical sites. Likewise, we will apply our unitary :math:`U` to
# a sequence of physical sites (each in the initial state :math:`|0\rangle`) while passing
# on a single bond site. This way, we chain up the unitaries on the bond site like beads
# on a string.
#
# .. image:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/constant_depth_mps_prep/sequential.png
#     :width: 75%
#     :align: center
#
# Alongside the correspondence between :math:`U` acting on :math:`|0\rangle` and :math:`A,`
# these steps are visualized in the sketch above.
# Note that the sketch deviates from standard circuit diagrams:
# Usually each wire corresponds to one qudit in the algorithm and the position of
# the qudits is fixed through the wire position. Here, the two bond qudits start as
# the top two wires, and one of them is moved to the bottom throughout the circuit.
#
# The sequential preparation circuit now consists of the following steps.
#
# #. Start in the state :math:`|\psi_0\rangle = |0\rangle^{\otimes N}\otimes |00\rangle_D.`
#    The last two sites are non-physical bond sites, encoded by :math:`D`-dimensional qudits.
#
# #. Entangle the bond qudits into the state
#    :math:`|I\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}}\sum_j |jj\rangle_D.`
#
# #. Apply the unitary :math:`U` to each of the :math:`N` physical sites, with the
#    :math:`D`-dimensional tensor factor always acting on the first bond qudit.
#    Denoting :math:`U` acting on the :math:`i`\ -th physical site and the first bond site
#    by :math:`U^{(i)},` this produces the following state.
#
#    .. math::
#
#        |\psi_1\rangle
#        &= \prod_{i=N}^{1} U^{(i)} |0\rangle^{\otimes N} \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}} \sum_j|jj\rangle _D\\
#        &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}} \sum_j \prod_{i=N-1}^{1} U^{(i)}
#        \sum_{m_N=0}^{d-1} |0\rangle^{\otimes N-1}|m_N\rangle A^{m_N}|jj\rangle _D\\
#        &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}} \sum_j
#        \sum_{\vec{m}} |\vec{m}\rangle A^{m_1} A^{m_2}\cdots A^{m_N}|jj\rangle_D\\
#        &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}} \sum_{j,k}
#        \sum_{\vec{m}} |\vec{m}\rangle \langle j|A^{m_1} A^{m_2}\cdots A^{m_N}|k\rangle |jk\rangle_D
#
#    We can see how each :math:`U^{(i)}` contributes a factor of :math:`A` and a corresponding
#    state :math:`|m_i\rangle` on the :math:`i`\ -th physical site. The same would have
#    come out when applying the 3-tensor :math:`A` to the first bond site :math:`N` times.
#
# #. Measure the two bond qudits in the (generalized) Bell basis and postselect on the outcome
#    being :math:`|I\rangle.` Then discard the bond qudits, which collapses :math:`|\psi_1\rangle`
#    into the state
#
#    .. math::
#
#        |\psi_2\rangle
#        = \sum_{\vec{m}} \operatorname{tr}[A^{m_1}A^{m_2}\cdots A^{m_N}]|\vec{m}\rangle
#        = |\Psi\rangle.
#
#    Note that this step is *probabilistic* and we only succeed to produce the state if we measure
#    the state :math:`|I\rangle.`
#
# We see that we prepared :math:`|\Psi\rangle` with an entangling operation on the bond qudits, one unitary per
# physical qubit, and a final basis change to measure the Bell basis. Overall, this amounts to a linear
# operation count and circuit depth.
#
# **Example**
#
# For our example MPS :math:`|\Psi(g)\rangle,` let us first find the unitary :math:`U.`
# For this, consider the fixed part of :math:`U.`

E_00 = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 0]])  # |0><0|
E_10 = np.array([[0, 0], [1, 0]])  # |1><0|
U_first_term = np.kron(A_0, E_00) + np.kron(A_1, E_10)

print(np.round(U_first_term, 5))
print(np.linalg.norm(U_first_term, axis=0))

######################################################################
# We see that this fixed part has two norm-1 columns already, i.e., it maps the input states
# :math:`|00\rangle` and :math:`|10\rangle` to normalized, orthogonal quantum states.
# We can complement this by mapping :math:`|01\rangle` and :math:`|11\rangle` to two other
# normalized states that are mutually orthogonal again. This turns out to be easy for the
# small example here and leads to the following:

E_01 = np.array([[0, 1], [0, 0]])  # |0><1|
E_11 = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1]])  # |1><1|
C_perp = np.kron(A_1, E_01) + np.kron(A_0, E_11)

U = U_first_term + C_perp

print(np.round(U, 5))
print(f"\nU is unitary: {np.allclose(U.conj().T @ U, np.eye(4))}")


######################################################################
# Great! This means that we already found the unitary :math:`U` for this MPS.
# We will implement it as the matrix that it is via :class:`~.pennylane.QubitUnitary`.
# If you're curious, you can try to decompose it into elementary gates (hint: you only
# need two!).
#
# Now let's code up the entire sequential preparation circuit (we will be applying
# the unitary :math:`U` to the second instead of the first bond qubit). We implement the
# measurement and postselection step as a separate function ``project_measure`` for
# easier reusability later on.

# The sequential preparation circuit already uses mid-circuit measurements, as is visible
# from the measurement steps on the first and last qubit, which are set to postselect the
# outcome :math:`|0\rangle.` However, there is no feedforward control that modifies the circuit
# dynamically based on measured values. This will change in the following sections.
#
# Fusion of MPS states with mid-circuit measurements
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The next ingredient for the constant-depth MPS preparation circuit is to fuse the product
# state of two MPS states together into one (entangled) MPS. Recall that a single sequential
# creation of this final MPS would pass a bond site between the first and second group of physical
# sites, chaining them like beads on the same string. The fusion step allows us to replace
# this connection with dynamic circuit components after creating two independent MPS.
# This is like knotting together two strings on which we chained beads independently before.
# As a matter of fact, chaining beads on smaller strings and the fact that we can knot them
# together simultaneously is at the heart of going from linear to constant circuit depth.
#
# Before we dive into the mathematical details, we visualize the idea behind the fusion step
# schematically:
#
# .. image:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/constant_depth_mps_prep/fusion.png
#     :width: 75%
#     :align: center
#
# Consider a state :math:`|\Phi\rangle=|\Phi_1\rangle\otimes|\Phi_2\rangle,` where
#
# .. math::
#
#     |\Phi_{r}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}} \sum_{j,k}
#     \sum_{\vec{m}} |\vec{m}\rangle \langle j|A^{m_1} A^{m_2}\cdots A^{m_{N_r}}|k\rangle |jk\rangle_D
#
# for :math:`r=1,2` are MPS on :math:`N_r` qudits, respectively. We assume that they have been
# prepared with the sequential technique from above, but that the bond
# qudits have not been measured yet. In particular, the postselection step has not been performed
# yet. Using the form of :math:`|\psi_1\rangle` from the recipe above, we can write
# this state as
#
# .. math::
#
#     |\Phi\rangle = \frac{1}{D} \sum_{j,k,\ell,p}
#     \sum_{\vec{m}} |\vec{m}\rangle  |jk\ell p\rangle_D
#     \langle j|A^{m_1} \cdots A^{m_{N_1}}|k\rangle_D
#     \langle \ell|A^{m_{{N_1}+1}} \cdots A^{m_{{N_1}+{N_2}}}|p\rangle_D.
#
# Now we want to measure two bond qudits in an entangled basis, one of
# :math:`|\Phi_1\rangle` and :math:`|\Phi_2\rangle` each (e.g., the ones indexed
# by :math:`k` and :math:`\ell` above). Assume this basis
# to be given in the form of (orthogonal) states
#
# .. math::
#
#     |B^k\rangle=\frac{1}{D} \sum_{j,\ell=1}^D \left(B_{j\ell}^k\right)^\ast |j\ell\rangle,
#
# which in turn are characterized by :math:`D\times D` matrices :math:`B^k.`
# We can change the basis on the bond qudits to be measured by applying the unitary
# :math:`V=\sum_k |k\rangle\!\langle B^k|,` which leads to the state
#
# .. math::
#
#     |\Phi'\rangle = \frac{1}{D} \sum_k \sum_{i,j,\ell,p}
#     \sum_{\vec{m}} |\vec{m}\rangle  |k\rangle_{D^2} |ip\rangle_D
#     \langle i|A^{m_1} \cdots A^{m_K}B^kA^{m_{K+1}} \cdots A^{m_{K+L}}|p\rangle_D,
#
# where we used that :math:`\sum_{j,\ell} |j\rangle B^k_{j\ell}\langle\ell|=B^k.`
# We now can measure the two bond qudits and will know that for a given measurement
# outcome :math:`k,` we obtained the MPS state on :math:`K+L` qubits, up to
# a defect, namely the matrix :math:`B^k` that depends to the outcome.
#
# In full generality, the fusion strategy may seem complicated, but it can take
# a very simple form, as we will now see in our example.
#
# **Example**
#
# We will use the Bell basis to perform the mid-circuit measurement, i.e.,
#
# .. math::
#
#     |B^0\rangle &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle+|11\rangle)\quad
#     |B^1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|01\rangle+|10\rangle)\\
#     |B^2\rangle &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle-|11\rangle)\quad
#     |B^3\rangle = \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}(|01\rangle-|10\rangle).
#
# This choice must seem arbitrary at this point, but will become clear
# later on. There, we will see that in general the matrices :math:`B^k` and the MPS
# tensor :math:`A` have to "play well" together.
# As an example, this choice leads to :math:`B^1_{j\ell} = 1` for
# :math:`(j,\ell)=(0, 1)` and :math:`(j, \ell)=(1,0),` and :math:`B^1_{j\ell}=0`
# otherwise (note that the factor :math:`\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}` is not part of :math:`B^k`
# in the general equation above). This means that :math:`B^1=X,` the Pauli matrix!
# Similarly, we find
#
# .. math::
#
#     B^0 = I \quad B^1 = X \quad B^2 = Z \quad B^3 = Y,
#
# i.e., all standard Pauli matrices.
# The measurement procedure can then be coded up in the following short function,
# which is similar to the ``project_measure`` function from the sequential preparation
# routine. Note, however, that instead of postselecting, we record the measurement
# outcome in the form of two bits representing the index :math:`k` of the operator
# :math:`B^k, which we will use further below.

# This means we still need a way to remove the defect matrices :math:`B^k` from the

# *Operator pushing* will allow us to do exactly that!
#
# Operator pushing
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The last building block we need is so-called operator pushing. In fact, whether or not an MPS
# can be prepared with the constant-depth circuit depends on whether certain operator pushing
# relations are satisfied between the matrices :math:`B^k` from the fusion step and the MPS
# tensor :math:`A.` We will not go into detail about these conditions but assume here that
# we work with compatible MPS and measurements.
#
# Operator pushing then allows us to push a defect operator :math:`B^k` from one bond
# axis through the tensor :math:`A` of the MPS to the other bond axis and to the physical axis.
# In general, doing so will change the operator, i.e., we end up with different operators
# :math:`C^k` and :math:`D^k` on the bond and physical axes, respectively.
# Visually, we find:
#
# .. image:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/constant_depth_mps_prep/operator_pushing.png
#     :width: 80%
#     :align: center
#
# For simplicity, we denote a push by :math:`B^k\mapsto (C^k, D^k).`
#
# **Example**
#
# In the fusion step above we picked the Bell basis as measurement basis, without
# further specifying why. As we saw, this basis leads to Pauli matrices as impurities
# :math:`B^k.` It turns out that those matrices satisfy simple pushing relations together with
# the tensor :math:`A` of our example MPS :math:`|\Psi(g)\rangle,` explaining this choice of
# measurement basis. In particular, the relations are

# :math:`X\mapsto (Y, Y),`
# :math:`Y\mapsto (Y, X),` and
# :math:`Z\mapsto (I, Z).`
# Note that the bond axis operator either is trivial (the identity), or a Pauli :math:`Y` operator.
# These pushing relations allow us to push the bond axis operator through to an open boundary
# bond axis of the fused MPS. In addition, we can remove the operators on the physical axes by
# applying the correct Pauli operation to the physical site, conditioned on the fusion measurement
# outcomes. If we have an MPS on :math:`L` sites, pushing through a Pauli will have the
# following effect:
#
# - If it is a Pauli :math:`Y,` all physical sites need to be corrected by a Pauli :math:`X,` and
#   a Pauli :math:`Y` is pushed to the opposite bond site.
#
# - If it is a Pauli :math:`X,` a Pauli :math:`Y` is applied to the first physical qubit, and afterwards
#   the case above is recovered, leading to applying Pauli :math:`X` and pushing through a Pauli :math:`Y.`
#
# - If it is a Pauli :math:`Z,` a Pauli :math:`Z` is applied to the first physical qubit and we are done.
#   No operator is pushed through on the bond axis.
#
# We can recast this condition into the following dynamic circuit instructions:
#
# - If the first/second bit of the measurement outcome bitstring is active, apply a Pauli :math:`Z/Y`
#   to the first physical qubit.
#
# - If the second bit is active, apply a Pauli :math:`X` to all other physical qubits.
#
# This pushing and correction step is captured by the following function.

# Piecing the algorithm together
# ------------------------------
#
# Now that we discussed the sequential preparation algorithm, fusion with mid-circuit
# measurements, and operator pushing, we have all components for the constant-depth
# preparation algorithm. As inputs it requires the tensor :math:`A` (or the unitary
# :math:`U` to reproduce :math:`A`), the total number of physical sites :math:`N,`
# and the block size :math:`q.`
#
# #. Prepare :math:`\frac{N}{q}` MPS of size :math:`q`
#    in parallel, using the sequential preparation algorithm (without the final
#    projection step).
#
# #. Fuse together the blocks of MPS using mid-circuit measurements and store the
#    measurement outcomes.
#
# #. Push the resulting defect operators to one of the outer bond sites and
#    conditionally apply correction operators to the physical sites.
#
# #. Undo the operator that was pushed to the outer bond site by conditionally applying
#    its inverse.
#
# #. Perform the same projection step as in the sequential preparation algorithm on
#    the two remaining bond sites.
#
# We summarize the algorithm in the following sketch, which again follows [#smith]_.
#
# .. image:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/constant_depth_mps_prep/algorithm.png
#     :width: 90%
#     :align: center
#
# It is important to remember that showing the existence of suitable operator pushing
# relations (and finding them explicitly) is a crucial step of the algorithm, which goes
# beyond the scope of the demo.
#
# The projective measurement step at the end is the same as for the sequential
# preparation algorithm, and therefore is *probabilistic*, with the same
# success probability.
#
# **The block size** :math:`q`
#
# The size of the blocks that have to be prepared in the first step depends on multiple
# considerations. First, the block must be such that operator pushing relations are
# available. Often this will determine a minimal block size, and multiples of that
# size are valid choices as well. Second, the depth of the (parallelized) sequential
# preparation circuits is proportional to :math:`q,` determining a key contribution
# to the overall depth of the algorithm. Third, the sequential algorithm requires
# two bond qudits for each block, leading to :math:`\frac{2N}{q}` auxiliary qudits
# overall. Note how the product of the depth and the number of auxiliary qubits is
# linear in :math:`N.`
#
# **Example**
#
# For our example MPS :math:`|\Psi(g)\rangle,` we already defined and coded up the
# sequential preparation circuit for a flexible number of qubits (Step 1),
# the measurement-based fusion (Step 2), and the operator pushing and correction step
# (Step 3). This makes putting the algorithm together quite simple. We only need to
# define an XOR for our operator bit strings and a function that applies a correcting
# Pauli operator to the final bond site after pushing through the operator (Step 4).

# Nice, we arrived at a *constant-depth* circuit that reproduces the existing sequential
# preparation circuit, which has linear depth!
# Note that while the dynamic operations of steps 2 and 3 appear visually to have a linear depth,
# they can be applied in parallel because they are only controlled by classical
# registers.
#
# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# We successfully implemented a constant-depth dynamic quantum circuit that
# prepares an MPS with a parametrized correlation length. In particular,
# we saw that a dynamic quantum circuit can reach quantum states in constant depth
# that require linear depth with purely unitary circuits.
# The cost for this advantage are the auxiliary qubits we had to add as intermediate
# bond sites.
# This constant-depth algorithm is an exciting advance in
# state preparation techniques, alleviating requirements of coherence times and
# connectivity on hardware.
#
# We want to note that there are other MPS preparation algorithms with depths that only
# scale logarithmically in the qubit count [#malz1]_. They, too, can be improved further by
# using mid-circuit measurements and dynamic circuit operations [#malz2]_
#
# For more information, consider the original article, the mentioned reviews, as well
# as our demos on dynamic circuits and tensor network states.
#
# Happy preparing!

r"""Constant-depth preparation of matrix product states with dynamic circuits
=============================================================================

Matrix product states (MPS) are used in a plethora of applications on quantum
many-body systems, both on classical and quantum computers.
This makes the preparation of MPS on a quantum computer an important subroutine.

In this demo you will learn to prepare certain MPS with a dynamic
quantum circuit of constant depth. We will implement the circuit, which makes use
of mid-circuit measurements and conditionally applied operations, for a specific
MPS, and compare it to a (static) sequential circuit with linear depth.
We will closely follow the eponymous article by Smith et al. [#smith]_.

.. note::

    If you would like to first learn about the dynamic circuit tools used in this
    algorithm, have a look at our :doc:`introduction to mid-circuit measurements
    </demos/tutorial_mcm_introduction>` and learn :doc:`how to collect statics of
    mid-circuit measurements </demos/tutorial_how_to_collect_mcm_stats>` and
    :doc:`how to create dynamic circuits with mid-circuit measurements
    </demos/tutorial_how_to_create_dynamic_mcm_circuits>`.

    If you first want to familiarize yourself with tensor network states and MPS
    in particular, take a look at our demo on
    :doc:`tensor-network quantum circuits </demos/tutorial_tn_circuits>`.
    Finally, our demo on :doc:`initial state preparation for quantum chemistry
    </demos/tutorial_initial_state_preparation>` shows you how to
    proceed to a concrete application, once an MPS is prepared.

Outline
-------

We will start by briefly (no, really!) introducing the building blocks for
the algorithm from a mathematical perspective. One of these blocks
is the sequential MPS preparation circuit to which we will compare later.
Alongside this introduction we describe and code up each building block for a
specific MPS and verify the conditions for the algorithm to apply. 
Finally, we combine the building blocks into the constant-depth algorithm by
Smith et al. We conclude by computing the correlation length of the prepared MPS.

Mathematical derivation
-----------------------

We briefly introduce MPS and a sequential circuit with linear
depth to prepare them, as well as two tools from quantum information theory
that we will use below: fusion of MPS with mid-circuit measurements
and *operator pushing*.

Matrix product states
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Matrix product states (MPS) are an important class of quantum states.
They can be described and manipulated conveniently on classical computers and
are able to approximate relevant states in quantum many-body systems.
In particular, MPS can efficiently describe ground states of (gapped local)
one-dimensional Hamiltonians, which in addition can be found efficiently using
density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithms.
For reviews of MPS see [#todo].

Following [#smith]_, we will look at translation-invariant MPS
of a quantum :math:`N`-body system where each body, or site, has local (physical)
dimension :math:`d`. We will further restrict to periodic boundary conditions,
corresponding to translational invariance of the MPS on a closed loop.
A general MPS with this properties is given by

.. math::

    |\Psi\rangle = \sum_{\vec{m}} \operatorname{tr}[A^{m_1}A^{m_2}\cdots A^{m_N}]|\vec{m}\rangle,

where :math:`\vec{m}` is a multi-index of :math:`N` indices ranging over :math:`d`,
i.e., :math:`\vec{m}\in\{0, 1 \dots, d-1\}^N`, and :math:`\{A^{m}\}_{m}` are :math:`d`
square matrices of equal dimension. This dimension :math:`D` is called the bond dimension,
which is a crucial quantity for the expressivity and complexity of the MPS.
We see that :math:`|\Psi\rangle` is fully specified by the :math:`d\times D\times D=dD^2`
numbers in the rank-3 tensor :math:`A`.
However, this specification is not unique. We remove some of the redundancies by assuming
that :math:`A` is in so-called left-canonical form, meaning that it satisfies

.. math::

    \sum_m {A^m}^\dagger A^m = \mathbb{I}.

We will not discuss additional redundancies here but refer to [#smith]_ and the
mentioned reviews for more details.

**Example**

As an example, consider a chain of :math:`N` qubits (:math:`d=2`) and a :math:`D=2` MPS
:math:`|\Psi(g)\rangle` on this system, defined by the matrices

.. math::

    A^0 = \eta \left(\begin{matrix} 1 & 0 \\ \sqrt{-g} & 0 \end{matrix}\right)
    \quad
    A^1 = \eta \left(\begin{matrix} 0 & -\sqrt{-g} \\ 0 & 1 \end{matrix}\right)

where :math:`\eta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-g}}` and :math:`g\in[-1, 0]` is a freely chosen parameter.

This MPS is a simple yet important example because it can be tuned from the long-range correlated
GHZ state :math:`|\Psi(0)\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle^{\otimes N} + |1\rangle^{\otimes N})`
to the state :math:`|\Psi(-1)\rangle=|+\rangle^{\otimes N}` with vanishing correlation length.
In general, the correlation length of :math:`|\Psi(g)\rangle` is given by

.. math::

    \xi(g) = \left|\ln\left(\frac{1+g}{1-g}\right)\right|^{-1}.

Long-range correlated states require linear-depth unitary circuits in general.
Therefore, the constant-depth circuit for :math:`|\Psi(0)\rangle` will demonstrate
that dynamic quantum circuits are more powerful than unitary operations alone.

The MPS :math:`|\Psi(g)\rangle` will be our working example throughout this demo. Therefore
we warm up our coding by defining the tensor :math:`A` and testing its properties.

# Sequential preparation circuit
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# An MPS like the one above can be prepared in linear depth using an established technique
# by SchÃ¶n et al. [#schoen]_. We introduce this technique here because the new
# constant-depth construction uses it as a parallelized subroutine, and because we will
# later compare the two approaches.
#
# The MPS :math:`|\Psi\rangle` above is given by the rank-3 tensor :math:`A`.
# In order to prepare the state in a circuit, we want to construct unitary operations
# from :math:`A`. For this, we build a new rank-4 tensor :math:`U` with an additional
# axis of dimension :math:`d`. If this new physical input axis is in the state
# :math:`|0\rangle`, we demand :math:`U` to reproduce one :math:`A^m` for each physical
# output state :math:`|m\rangle`. We leave the remaining action undefined and only require
# it to make :math:`U` unitary overall. In short, this can be written as
#
# .. math::
#
#     U = \sum_m A^m \otimes |m\rangle\!\langle 0| + C_\perp,
#
# where :math:`C_\perp` can be any operator making :math:`U` unitary.
# The sequential preparation circuit now consists of the following steps.
#
# #. Start in the state :math:`|\psi_0\rangle = |0\rangle^{\otimes N}\otimes |00\rangle_D`.
#    The last two sites are non-physical bond sites, encoded by :math:`D`-dimensional qudits.
#
# #. Entangle the bond qudits into the state :math:`|I\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}}\sum_j |jj\rangle_D`.
#
# #. Apply the unitary :math:`U` once to each of the :math:`N` physical sites, with the
#    :math:`D`-dimensional tensor factor always acting on the first bond qudit, denoted by :math:`U^{(i)}`.
#    This produces the state
#
#    .. math::
#
#        |\psi_1\rangle
#        &= \prod_{i=N}^{1} U^{(i)} |0\rangle^{\otimes N} \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}} \sum_j|jj\rangle _D\\
#        &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}} \sum_j \prod_{i=N-1}^{1} U^{(i)}
#        \sum_{m_N=0}^{d-1} |0\rangle^{\otimes N-1}|m_N\rangle A^{m_N}|jj\rangle _D\\
#        &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}} \sum_j
#        \sum_{\vec{m}} |\vec{m}\rangle A^{m_1} A^{m_2}\cdots A^{m_N}|jj\rangle_D\\
#        &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}} \sum_{i,j}
#        \sum_{\vec{m}} |\vec{m}\rangle \langle i|A^{m_1} A^{m_2}\cdots A^{m_N}|j\rangle |ij\rangle_D
#
# #. Measure the two bond qudits in the (generalized) Bell basis and postselect on the outcome
#    being :math:`|I\rangle`. Then discard the bond qudits, which collapses :math:`|\psi_1\rangle`
#    into the state
#
#    .. math::
#
#        |\psi_2\rangle = \sum_{\vec{m}} \operatorname{tr}[A^{m_1}A^{m_2}\cdots A^{m_N}]|\vec{m}\rangle = |\Psi\rangle
#
#    Note that this step is *probabilistic* and we only succeed to produce the state if we measure
#    the state :math:`|I\rangle`.
#
# We see that we prepared :math:`|\Psi\rangle` with an entangling operation on the bond qudits, one unitary per
# physical qubit, and a final basis change to measure the Bell basis. Overall, this amounts to a linear
# operation count and circuit depth.
#
# **Example**
#
# For our example MPS :math:`|\Psi(g)\rangle`, let us first find the unitary :math:`U`.
# For this, consider the fixed part of :math:`U`.

E_00 = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 0]])  # |0><0|
E_10 = np.array([[0, 0], [1, 0]])  # |1><0|
U_first_term = np.kron(A_0, E_00) + np.kron(A_1, E_10)

print(np.round(U_first_term, 5))
print(np.linalg.norm(U_first_term, axis=0))

######################################################################
# We see that this fixed part has two norm-1 columns already, and we are
# able to complement this by :math:`C_\perp` using the same columns, but with shifted rows:

E_01 = np.array([[0, 1], [0, 0]])  # |0><1|
E_11 = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1]])  # |1><1|
C_perp = np.kron(A_1, E_01) + np.kron(A_0, E_11)

U = U_first_term + C_perp

print(np.round(U, 5))
print(f"\nU is unitary: {np.allclose(U.conj().T @ U, np.eye(4))}")


######################################################################
# Great! This means that we already found the unitary :math:`U` for this MPS.
# Combining the terms above on paper, we see that
#
# .. math::
#
#     U &= A^0 \otimes (|0\rangle\!\langle 0| + |1\rangle\!\langle 1|)
#     + A^1\otimes (|1\rangle\!\langle 0| + |0\rangle\!\langle 1|)\\
#     &= A^0 \otimes \mathbb{I} + A^1\otimes X
#
# This looks a lot like a :class:`~.pennylane.CNOT` gate plays a part in :math:`U`.
# Removing it from :math:`U` we find
#
# .. math::
#
#     U \operatorname{CNOT}
#     &= (A^0 P_0) \otimes \mathbb{I} + (A^0P_1) \otimes X + (A^1 P_0) \otimes X + (A^1P_1) \otimes \mathbb{I}\\
#     &= \left(\begin{matrix} \eta & -\eta\sqrt{-g} \\ \eta\sqrt{-g} & \eta \end{matrix}\right)\otimes \mathbb{I},
#
# where we denoted the computational basis state projectors as
# :math:`P_i = |i\rangle\!\langle i|`. The remaining operation is an
# :class:`~.pennylane.RY` rotation by the angle :math:`2\arccos(\eta)`, so
# that we can easily code up the unitary as a small circuit template:


def U_template(eta, bond_idx, phys_idx):
    qml.CNOT([bond_idx, phys_idx])
    qml.RY(2 * np.arccos(eta), bond_idx)


eta = 1 / np.sqrt(1 - g)

# As we can see, the sequential preparation circuit already uses mid-circuit
# measurements. However, there is no feed forward control that modifies the circuit
# dynamically based on measured values.
#
# Fusion of MPS states with mid-circuit measurements
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The next ingredient for the constant-depth MPS preparation circuit is to fuse
# two MPS states together into one MPS. Under the hood, this is
# an application of entanglement swapping.
#
# Consider a state :math:`|\Phi\rangle=|\Phi_1\rangle\otimes|\Phi_2\rangle`, where
# :math:`|\Phi_{1,2}\rangle` are MPS prepared with the sequential technique from
# above on :math:`K` and :math:`L` physical qudits, respectively, but with the bond
# qudits left unmeasured. In particular, the postselection step has not been performed
# yet. Using the form of :math:`|\psi_1\rangle` from the recipe above, we can write
# this state as
#
# .. math::
#
#     |\Phi\rangle = \frac{1}{D} \sum_{i,j,\ell,p}
#     \sum_{\vec{m}} |\vec{m}\rangle  |ij\ell p\rangle_D
#     \langle i|A^{m_1} \cdots A^{m_K}|j\rangle_D
#     \langle \ell|A^{m_{K+1}} \cdots A^{m_{K+L}}|p\rangle_D.
#
# Now we want to measure two bond qudits in an entangled basis, one of
# :math:`|\Phi_1\rangle` and :math:`|\Phi_2\rangle` each. Assume this basis
# to be given in the form of (orthogonal) states
#
# .. math::
#
#     |B^k\rangle=\frac{1}{D} \sum_{j,\ell=1}^D \left(B_{j\ell}^k\right)^\ast |j\ell\rangle,
#
# which in turn are characterized by :math:`D\times D` matrices :math:`B^k`.
# We can change the basis on the bond qudits to be measured by applying the unitary
# :math:`V=\sum_k |k\rangle\!\langle B^k|`, which leads to the state
#
# .. math::
#
#     |\Phi'\rangle = \frac{1}{D} \sum_k \sum_{i,j,\ell,p}
#     \sum_{\vec{m}} |\vec{m}\rangle  |k\rangle_{D^2} |ip\rangle_D
#     \langle i|A^{m_1} \cdots A^{m_K}B^kA^{m_{K+1}} \cdots A^{m_{K+L}}|p\rangle_D,
#
# where we used that :math:`\sum_{j,\ell} |j\rangle B^k_{j\ell}\langle\ell|=B^k`.
# We now can measure the two bond qudits and will know that for a given measurement
# outcome :math:`k`, we obtained the MPS state on :math:`K+L` qubits, up to
# a small "impurity", namely the matrix :math:`B^k` that depends to the outcome.
#
# In full generality, the fusion strategy may seem complicated, but it can take
# a very simply form, as we will now see in our example:
#
# **Example**
#
# We will use the Bell basis to perform the mid-circuit measurement, i.e.,
#
# .. math::
#
#     |B^0\rangle &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle+|11\rangle)\quad
#     |B^1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|01\rangle+|10\rangle)\\
#     |B^2\rangle &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle-|11\rangle)\quad
#     |B^3\rangle = \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}(|01\rangle-|10\rangle).
#
# This choice must seem arbitrary at this point, but will become clear
# later on. There, we will see that in general the matrices :math:`B^k` and the MPS
# tensor :math:`A` have to "play well" together. For the choice above, we find the matrices
#
# .. math::
#
#     B^0 = I \quad B^1 = X \quad B^2 = Z \quad B^3 = Y,
#
# i.e., the standard Pauli matrices.
# The measurement procedure can then be coded up in the following short function,
# which is similar to the ``project_measure`` function from the sequential preparation
# routine. Note, however, that instead of postselecting, we record the measurement
# outcome in the form of two bits representing the index :math:`k` of the operator
# :math:`B^k`, which we will use further below.

######################################################################
# This means we still need a way to remove the impurity matrices :math:`B^k` from the
# state that ended up in the prepared state when we performed the fusion measurement.
# *Operator pushing* will allow us to do exactly that!
#
# Operator pushing
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The last building block we need is so-called operator pushing. In fact, whether or not an MPS
# can be prepared with the constant-depth circuit depends on whether certain operator pushing
# relations are satisfied between the matrices :math:`B^k` from the fusion step and the MPS
# tensor :math:`A`. We will not go into detail about these conditions but assume here that
# we work with compatible MPS and measurements.
#
# Operator pushing then allows us to push an impurity operator :math:`B^k` from one bond
# axis through the tensor :math:`A` of the MPS to the other bond axis and to the physical axis.
# While doing so, the operator in general will change, i.e., we end up with different operators
# :math:`C^k` and :math:`D^k` on the bond and physical axes, respectively.
# Visually, we find:
#
# .. image:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/constant_depth_mps_prep/operator_pushing.png
#
# For simplicity, we denote a push by :math:`B^k\mapsto (C^k, D^k)`.
#
# **Example**
#
# In the fusion step above we picked the Bell basis as measurement basis, without
# further specifying why. As we saw, this basis leads to Pauli matrices as impurities
# :math:`B^k`. It turns out that those matrices satisfy simple pushing relations together with
# the tensor :math:`A` of our example MPS :math:`|\Psi(g)\rangle`, explaining this choice of
# measurement basis. In particular, the relations are
#
# .. image:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/constant_depth_mps_prep/operator_pushing_example.png
#
# That is, in the notation above we have
# :math:`X\mapsto (Y, Y)`,
# :math:`Y\mapsto (Y, X)`, and
# :math:`Z\mapsto (I, Z)` as well as the trivial
# :math:`I\mapsto (I, I)`.
# Note that the bond axis operator either is trivial (the identity), or a Pauli-:math:`Y` operator.
# These pushing relations allow us to push the bond axis operator through to an open boundary
# bond axis of the fused MPS. In addition, we can remove the operators on the physical axes by
# applying the correct Pauli operation to the physical site, conditioned on the fusion measurement
# outcomes. If we have an MPS on :math:`L` sites, pushing through a Pauli will have the
# following effect:
#
# - If it is a Pauli-:math:`Y`, all physical sites need to be corrected by a Pauli-:math:`X`, and
#   a Pauli-:math:`Y` is pushed to the opposite bond site.
#
# - If it is a Pauli-:math:`X`, a Pauli-:math:`Y` is applied to the first physical qubit, and afterwards
#   the case above is recovered, leading to applying Pauli-:math:`X` and pushing through a Pauli-:math:`Y`.
#
# - If it is a Pauli-:math:`Z`, a Pauli-:math:`Z` is applied to the first physical qubit and we are done.
#   No operator is pushed through on the bond axis.
#
# We can recast this condition into the following dynamic circuit instructions:
#
# - If the first (second) bit of the measurement outcome bitstring is active, apply a Pauli-:math:`Z`
#   (Pauli-:math:`Y`) to the first physical qubit
#
# - If the second bit is active, apply a Pauli-:math:`X` to all other physical qubits.
#
# This pushing and correction step is captured by the following function.

# Piecing everything together
# ---------------------------
#
# Now that we discussed the sequential preparation algorithm, fusion with mid-circuit
# measurements, and operator pushing, we have all components for the constant-depth
# preparation algorithm.
#
# #. For a block size :math:`q`, prepare :math:`\frac{N}{q}` MPS of size :math:`q`
#    in parallel, using the sequential preparation algorithm (without the final
#    projection step).
#
# #. Fuse together the blocks of MPS using mid-circuit measurements and store the
#    measurement outcomes.
#
# #. Push the resulting impurity operators to one of the outer bond sites and
#    conditionally apply correction operators to the physical sites.
#
# #. Undo the operator that was pushed to the outer bond site by conditionally applying
#    its inverse.
#
# #. Perform the same projection step as in the sequential preparation algorithm on
#    the two remaining bond sites.
#
# It is important to remember that showing the existence of suitable operator pushing
# relations (and finding them explicitly) is a crucial step in general, which goes
# beyond the scope of the demo.
#
# Block size :math:`q`
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The size of the blocks that have to be prepared in the first step depends on multiple
# considerations. First, the block must be such that operator pushing relations are
# available. Often this will determine a minimal block size, and multiples of that
# size are valid choices as well. Second, the depth of the (parallelized) sequential
# preparation circuits is proportional to :math:`q`, determining a key contribution
# to the overall depth of the algorithm. Third, the sequential algorithm requires
# two bond qudits for each block, leading to :math:`\frac{2N}{q}` auxiliary qudits
# overall. Note how the product of the depth and the number of auxiliary qubits is
# linear in :math:`N`.
#

# Pauli operator to the final bond site after pushing through the operator (Step 4).

# correlated state, namely the GHZ state, for :math:`g\to 0`. We can visualize
# these states via their probability distributions (note the logarithmic axis).

# As we can see, the produced MPS states indeed have the predicted correlation lengths,
# up to some numerical imprecisions.
#
# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# We successfully implemented a constand-depth dynamic quantum circuit that
# prepares an MPS with a parametrized correlation length. In particular,
# we saw that a dynamic quantum circuit can reach quantum states in constant depth
# that require linear depth with purely unitary circuits.
# The cost for this advantage are the auxiliary qubits we had to add as intermediate
# bond sites. Nonetheless, this constant-depth algorithm is an exciting advance in
# state preparation techniques, alleviating requirements of coherence times and
# connectivity on hardware.
#
# For more information, consider the original article, the mentioned reviews, as well
# as our demos on dynamic circuits and tensor network states.
#
# Happy preparing!

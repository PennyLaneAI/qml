While the
`Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qaoa_intro.html>`__
is one of the best-known processes for solving combinatorial optimization problems with quantum computers,
it has a major drawback: convergence isn't guaranteed, as the optimization procedure can become "stuck" in local minima.

This tutorial explores the **FALQON** algorithm introduced in `a recent paper by Magann et al. <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08619.pdf>`__
It is similar in spirit to QAOA, but uses iterative feedback steps rather than a global optimization
over parameters, avoiding the use of a classical optimizer.

In this demo, we will implement FALQON to solve the MaxClique problem in graph theory, perform benchmarking, and
combine FALQON with QAOA to create a powerful optimization procedure.

.. note::
    If you are not familiar with QAOA, we recommend checking out the
    `Intro to QAOA tutorial <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qaoa_intro.html>`__,
    since many of the same ideas carry over and will be used throughout this demonstration.

Theory
------

To solve a combinatorial optimization problem with a quantum computer, a typical strategy is to encode
the solution to the problem as the ground state of a *cost Hamiltonian* :math:`H_c`. Then, we use some procedure to drive
an initial state into the ground state of :math:`H_c`.
FALQON falls under this broad scheme.

Consider a quantum system governed by a Hamiltonian of the form :math:`H = H_c + \beta(t) H_d`. These kinds of
Hamiltonians appear often in the theory of `quantum control <https://quantiki.org/wiki/quantum-control-theory>`__, a
field of inquiry which studies how a quantum system can be driven from one state to another.
The choice of :math:`\beta(t)` corresponds to a "driving strategy", which partially determines how the system evolves
with time.

Suppose our objective is to drive some quantum system
to the ground state of :math:`H_c`. It is a reasonable goal to
construct a quantum control process such that the energy expectation :math:`\langle H_c \rangle_t` decreases with time:

.. math:: \frac{d}{dt} \langle H_c\rangle_t = \frac{d}{dt} \langle \psi(t)|H_c|\psi(t)\rangle = i \beta(t)\langle [H_d, H_c] \rangle_t \leq 0,

where the product rule and
`the Schr√∂dinger equation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation#Time-dependent_equation>`__ are used to derive the above formula.
If we pick :math:`\beta(t) = -\langle i[H_d, H_c] \rangle_t,` so that

.. math:: \frac{d}{dt} \langle H_c\rangle_t = -|\langle i[H_d, H_c] \rangle_t|^2 \leq 0,

then :math:`\langle H_c \rangle` is guaranteed to strictly decrease, as desired!
Thus, if we evolve some initial state :math:`|\psi_0\rangle` under the time evolution operator :math:`U` corresponding to :math:`H`,

.. math:: U(T) = \mathcal{T} \exp \Big[ -i \displaystyle\int_{0}^{T} H(t) \ dt \Big] \approx \mathcal{T} \exp \Big[ -i \displaystyle\sum_{k = 0}^{T/\Delta t} H( k \Delta t) \Delta t \Big],

where :math:`\mathcal{T}` is the `time-ordering operator <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path-ordering#Time_ordering>`__ and :math:`\Delta t` is some small time step,
then the energy expectation will strictly decrease, for a large enough value of :math:`T`. This is exactly the procedure used by FALQON to minimize :math:`\langle H_c \rangle`.
In general, implementing a time evolution unitary in a quantum circuit is
difficult, so we use a
`Trotter-Suzuki decomposition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-evolving_block_decimation#The_Suzuki%E2%80%93Trotter_expansion>`__
to perform approximate time evolution. We then have

.. math:: U(T) \approx \mathcal{T} \exp \Big[ -i \displaystyle\sum_{k = 0}^{T/\Delta t} H( k \Delta t) \Delta t \Big] \approx
            e^{-i\beta_n H_d \Delta t} e^{-iH_c \Delta t} \cdots e^{-i\beta_1 H_d \Delta t} e^{-iH_c \Delta t} = U_d(\beta_n) U_c \cdots U_d(\beta_1) U_c,

where :math:`n = T/\Delta t` and :math:`\beta_k = \beta(k\Delta t)`.
For each layer of the time evolution, the value :math:`\beta_k` is required. However,
:math:`\beta_k` is dependent on the state of the system at some time. Recall that

.. math:: \beta(t) = - \langle \psi(t) | i [H_d, H_c] | \psi(t) \rangle.

We let :math:`A(t) := i\langle [H_d, H_c] \rangle_t`. Our strategy is to obtain the values
:math:`\beta_k` recursively, by finding the value of :math:`A(t)` for the **previous time step**. We then set

.. math:: \beta_{k+1} = -A_k = -A(k\Delta t).

This leads to the FALQON algorithm as a recursive process. On step :math:`k`, we perform the following three substeps:

1. Prepare the state :math:`|\psi_k\rangle = U_d(\beta_k) U_c \cdots U_d(\beta_1) U_c|\psi_0\rangle`.
2. Measure the expectation value :math:`A_k = \langle i[H_c, H_d]\rangle_{k \Delta t}`.
3. Set :math:`\beta_{k+1} = -A_k`.

We repeat for all :math:`k` from :math:`1` to :math:`n`, where :math:`n` is a hyperparameter.
At the final step we evaluate :math:`\langle H_c \rangle`,
which gives us an approximation for the ground state of :math:`H_c`.

# Simulating FALQON with PennyLane
# --------------------------------
# To begin, we import the necessary dependencies:
#

import pennylane as qml
from pennylane import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from pennylane import qaoa as qaoa
import networkx as nx

######################################################################
# In this demonstration, we will be using FALQON to solve the
# `maximum clique (MaxClique) problem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_problem>`__: finding the
# largest complete subgraph of some graph :math:`G`. For example, the following graph's maximum
# clique is coloured in red:
#
# .. figure:: ../demonstrations/falqon/max_clique.png
#     :align: center
#     :width: 90%
#
# We attempt to find the maximum clique of the graph below:
#

edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 3), (1, 4)]
graph = nx.Graph(edges)
nx.draw(graph, with_labels=True, node_color="#e377c2")

######################################################################
# We must first encode this combinatorial problem into a cost Hamiltonian :math:`H_c`. This ends up being
#
# .. math:: H_c = 3 \sum_{(i, j) \in E(\bar{G})} (Z_i Z_j - Z_i - Z_j) + \displaystyle\sum_{i \in V(G)} Z_i,
#
# where each qubit is a node in the graph, and the states :math:`|0\rangle` and :math:`|1\rangle`
# represent whether the vertex has been marked as part of the clique, as is the case for `most standard QAOA encoding
# schemes <https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03489>`__.
# Note that :math:`\bar{G}` is the complement of :math:`G`: the graph formed by connecting all nodes that **do not** share
# an edge in :math:`G`.
#
# In addition to defining :math:`H_c`, we also require a driver Hamiltonian :math:`H_d` which does not commute
# with :math:`H_c`. The driver Hamiltonian's role is similar to that of the mixer Hamiltonian in QAOA.
# To keep things simple, we choose a sum over Pauli :math:`X` operations on each qubit:
#
# .. math:: H_d = \displaystyle\sum_{i \in V(G)} X_i.
#
# These Hamiltonians come nicely bundled together in the PennyLane QAOA module:
#

cost_h, driver_h = qaoa.max_clique(graph, constrained=False)

print("Cost Hamiltonian")
print(cost_h)
print("Driver Hamiltonian")
print(driver_h)

######################################################################
# One of the main ingredients in the FALQON algorithm is the operator :math:`i [H_d, H_c]`. In
# the case of MaxClique, we can write down the commutator :math:`[H_d, H_c]` explicitly:
#
# .. math:: [H_d, H_c] = 3 \displaystyle\sum_{k \in V(G)} \displaystyle\sum_{(i, j) \in E(\bar{G})} \big( [X_k, Z_i Z_j] - [X_k, Z_i]
#           - [X_k, Z_j] \big) + 3 \displaystyle\sum_{i \in V(G)} \displaystyle\sum_{j \in V(G)} [X_i, Z_j].
#
# There are two distinct commutators that we must calculate, :math:`[X_k, Z_j]` and :math:`[X_k, Z_i Z_j]`.
# This is straightforward as we know exactly what the
# `commutators of the Pauli matrices <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices#Commutation_relations>`__ are.
# We have:
#
# .. math:: [X_k, Z_j] = -2 i \delta_{kj} Y_k \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ [X_k, Z_i Z_j] = -2 i \delta_{ik} Y_k Z_j - 2i \delta_{jk} Z_i Y_k,
#
# where :math:`\delta_{kj}` is the `Kronecker delta <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_delta>`__. Therefore it
# follows from substitution into the above equation and multiplication by :math:`i` that:
#
# .. math:: i [H_d, H_c] = 6 \displaystyle\sum_{k \in V(G)} \displaystyle\sum_{(i, j) \in E(\bar{G})} \big( \delta_{ki} Y_k Z_j +
#          \delta_{kj} Z_{i} Y_{k} - \delta_{ki} Y_k - \delta_{kj} Y_k \big) + 6 \displaystyle\sum_{i \in V(G)} Y_{i}.
#
# This new operator has quite a few terms! Therefore, we write a short method which computes it for us, and returns
# a :class:`~.pennylane.Hamiltonian` object. Note that this method works for any graph:
#

def build_hamiltonian(graph):
    H = qml.Hamiltonian([], [])

    # Computes the complement of the graph
    graph_c = nx.complement(graph)

    for k in graph_c.nodes:
        # Adds the terms in the first sum
        for edge in graph_c.edges:
            i, j = edge
            if k == i:
                H += 6 * (qml.PauliY(k) @ qml.PauliZ(j) - qml.PauliY(k))
            if k == j:
                H += 6 * (qml.PauliZ(i) @ qml.PauliY(k) - qml.PauliY(k))
        # Adds the terms in the second sum
        H += 6 * qml.PauliY(k)

    return H

# We can now build the FALQON algorithm. Our goal is to evolve some initial state under the Hamiltonian :math:`H`,

# Benchmarking FALQON
# -------------------
#
# After seeing how FALQON works, it is worth considering how well FALQON performs according to a set of benchmarking
# criteria on a batch of graphs. We generate graphs randomly using the
# `Erdos-Renyi model <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93R%C3%A9nyi_model>`__, where we start with
# the complete graph on :math:`n` vertices and then keep each edge with probability :math:`p`. We then find the maximum
# cliques on these graphs using the
# `Bron-Kerbosch algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bron%E2%80%93Kerbosch_algorithm>`__. To benchmark FALQON,
# the relative error in the estimated minimum energy
#
# .. math:: r_A = \frac{\langle H_C\rangle - \langle H_C\rangle_\text{min}}{|\langle H_C\rangle_\text{min}|}
#
# makes a good figure of merit.
#
# Final results for :math:`r_A`, along with :math:`\beta`, are plotted below,
# with the number of FALQON layers on the horizontal axis. We have averaged over :math:`50` random graphs per node
# size, for sizes :math:`n = 6, 7, 8, 9`, with probability :math:`p = 0.1` of keeping an edge. Running FALQON for
# :math:`40` steps, with :math:`\Delta t = 0.01`, produces:
#
# .. figure:: ../demonstrations/falqon/bench.png
#     :align: center
#     :width: 60%
#
# The relative error decreases with the number of layers (as we expect from the construction) and graph size (suggesting the errors grows
# more slowly than the minimum energy).
# The exception is :math:`n = 9`, where the step size has become too large
# and the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition breaks down.
# The rate of decrease also slows down. Even though the algorithm will converge to the ground state, it won't always get
# there in a few time steps!

######################################################################
# Seeding QAOA with FALQON (Bird Seed ü¶Ö)
# ---------------------------------------
#
# .. figure:: ../demonstrations/falqon/bird_seed.png
#     :align: center
#     :width: 90%
#
# Both FALQON and QAOA have unique benefits and drawbacks.
# While FALQON requires no classical optimization and is guaranteed to decrease the cost function
# with each iteration, its circuit depth grows linearly with the number of iterations. The benchmarking data also shows
# how the reduction in cost slows with each layer, and the additional burden of correctly tuning the time step. On the other hand, QAOA
# has a fixed circuit depth, but does require classical optimization, and is therefore subject to all of the drawbacks
# that come with probing a cost landscape for a set of optimal parameters.
#
# QAOA and FALQON also have many similarities, most notably, their circuit structure. Both
# involve alternating layers of time evolution operators corresponding to a cost and a mixer/driver Hamiltonian.
# The FALQON paper raises the idea of combining FALQON and QAOA to yield a new optimization algorithm that
# leverages the benefits of both. In this final section of the tutorial, we will implement this procedure in PennyLane.
#
# Suppose we want to run a QAOA circuit of depth :math:`p`. Our ansatz will be of the form
#
# .. math:: U_{\text{QAOA}} = e^{-i \alpha_p H_m} e^{-i \gamma_p H_c} \cdots e^{-i \alpha_1 H_m} e^{-i \gamma_1 H_c},
#
# for sets of parameters :math:`\{\alpha_k\}` and :math:`\{\gamma_k\}`, which are optimized.
# If we run FALQON for :math:`p` steps, setting :math:`H_d = H_m`, and use the same cost Hamiltonian, we will end up with
# the following ansatz:
#
# .. math:: U_{\text{FALQON}} = e^{-i \Delta t \beta_p H_m} e^{-i \Delta t H_c} \cdots e^{-i \Delta t \beta_1 H_m} e^{-i \Delta t H_c}.
#
# Thus, our strategy is to initialize our QAOA parameters using the :math:`\beta_k` values that FALQON yields.
# More specifically, we set :math:`\alpha_k = \Delta t \beta_k` and :math:`\gamma_k = \Delta t`. We then optimize
# over these parameters. The goal is that these parameters provide QAOA a good place in the parameter space to
# begin its optimization.
#
# Using the code from earlier in the demonstration, we can easily prototype this process. To illustrate the power of
# this new technique, we attempt to solve MaxClique on a slightly more complicated graph:

new_edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 3), (1, 4), (4, 5), (5, 2), (0, 6)]
new_graph = nx.Graph(new_edges)

r"""Generative quantum eigensolver (GQE) training using PennyLane data
===================================================

We will be demonstrating and evaluating a novel algorithm proposed by Nakaji et al. in their paper
`The generative quantum eigensolver (GQE) and its application for ground state search <https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09253>`__
that employs a classical generative model of quantum circuits for the purpose of ground-state
energy estimation of any molecular Hamiltonian [#nakaji2024]_.  
It has been proposed as a scalable alternative to the `variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_vqe/>`__ approach,
where the quantum state is represented as a quantum circuit with tunable parameters which are then optimized during training in order to arrive at a 
state minimizing the corresponding energy :math:`E`. Instead, in GQE, the structure of the quantum circuit is given by a trained generative model.

We will primarily focus on offline training on a fixed training dataset -- thanks to the molecular data
available in `PennyLane Datasets <https://pennylane.ai/datasets/>`__. 
By the end of the demo, we will show that the model gradually provides a better estimate for the energies and, in turn, 
can sample energies close to the ground state energy calculated by PennyLane. 

This demo is organized as follows. Firstly, we compare the GQE and VQE algorithms, and afterwards, we dive deeper in 
describing GPT-QE, i.e., the GQE algorithm which uses a GPT model, and its training. Next, we generate the training dataset for our GPT model using PennyLane,
and give details on our model architecture and training implementation. After that, we 
evaluate the model throughout its training and discuss its performance in estimating the ground
state. And lastly, we discuss the results, potential ways optimizing the code, and its extension into the 
"online training" phase.

# GQE vs. VQE
# -----------
# Despite the relative success of VQE, there are some issues regarding its *trainability* for large problem  
# instances [#nakaji2024]_. This shortcoming makes it less competitive against the performance of
# classical machine learning (ML) algorithms for large problems. To bypass this, the GQE algorithm was 
# proposed. Specifically, GQE uses a classical generative model where quantum circuits are sampled as a
# sequence of unitaries from a given operator pool. This generative model is then trained so that it learns to
# predict quantum circuits that evolves an initial state to the states better approximating the ground state. 
# 
# The main difference between the two approaches is where the tunable parameters are embedded.
# That is, it is the classical GQE model that is being optimized as opposed to the variable
# quantum circuit of VQE. Potentially then, the :doc:`barren plateau </demos/tutorial_barren_plateaus/>` landscape of 
# VQE and the quantum gradient evaluation of large circuits will be sidestepped by GQE, thus becoming more amenable 
# for larger problems.

# GPT-QE background
# --------------------
# 
# In particular, the model architecture used by Nakaji et al. [#nakaji2024]_ for GQE was a generative pre-trained
# transformer (GPT) [#radford2019]_, [#vaswani2017]_. This choice is then reflected in the name GPT-QE. 
# As language models, GPTs are successful in generating
# sequences of words that closely resemble human natural language. This performance is
# harnessed for quantum chemistry by constructing quantum states :math:`\rho` as a sequence of unitary operators 
# which are, in turn, represented by quantum circuits. That is, we let :math:`\rho = U\rho_0 U^{\dagger}`
# for some fixed initial state :math:`\rho_0` and the aforementioned sequence is :math:`U = U_{j_N}U_{j_{N-1}}\cdots U_{j_1}`.
# The GPT model samples a sequence of integers :math:`j_1, j_2, ..., j_N` indexing a pool 
# of operators :math:`U_j` generated using molecular data from `PennyLane Molecules <https://pennylane.ai/datasets/qchem>`__. We interpret these 
# integers as tokens and the pool as the vocabulary in the parlance for language models. 
# The goal of training is then to minimize the corresponding energy
# :math:`E = \mbox{Tr}(\hat{H}\rho)`, where :math:`\hat{H}` is the Hamiltonian of the molecule in 
# question.
# 
# Each token :math:`j_i` is sampled from the distribution :math:`\exp(-\beta w_{j_i})`, where
# :math:`w_{j_i}` is the unnormalized log probability (or logit) returned by the GPT model for the token :math:`j_i`
# and :math:`\beta` is an inverse temperature representing a trade-off parameter between exploration and exploitation. We then
# observe that the probability of sampling a state through the method described above is 
# proportional to :math:`\exp(-\beta w_{\mbox{sum}})`, where :math:`w_{\mbox{sum}} = \sum_{i=1}^N w_{j_i}` 
# and the probability for the corresponding energy is :math:`\exp(-\beta E)`. We thus have a constraint 
# for the total logit to be equal to the energy of the corresponding state: :math:`w_{\mbox{sum}} = E`, which
# can be imposed by training GPT-QE to minimize the loss function :math:`C = (w_{\mbox{sum}} - E)^2`.
# With this constraint satisfied, GPT-QE would then be sampling states of smaller energies with increasing
# likelihood.
#  
# More concretely, we summarize the *pre-*training loop in Figure 2. This is called
# pre-training because it involves learning from a fixed dataset first before transitioning to the "real" training 
# which utilizes the data generated by the model itself. In this demo, we will call the pre-training as offline
# training since the GPT model does not receive feedback from the sequences it samples, and online
# training if otherwise.

# Dataset construction via PennyLane
# -------------------------------------
# 
# Firstly, let us construct the static dataset we will use for offline training. We choose
# to generate our own dataset in order to illustrate the sequences and energies more concretely.
# Our dataset will be made from random sequences of tokens, which we recall corresponds to indices
# of a vocabulary of unitary operators. We then define an energy function in PennyLane to calculate 
# the energy of a state corresponding to a token sequence. Applying the aforementioned function,
# we would then have a dataset of token sequences and energies for the GPT model offline training.

######################################################################
# Loading molecular information
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# For simplicity, let us consider the `hydrogen molecule <https://pennylane.ai/datasets/qchem/h2-molecule>`__ 
# and load the corresponding dataset from PennyLane.
# Recall that we would need a vocabulary of operators :math:`U_j`, an initial state :math:`\rho_0`, and 
# the Hamiltonian :math:`\hat{H}` for a hydrogen molecule. We also get the ground state energy for later comparison
# with the results. 
# 
# Specifically, the unitary operators :math:`U_j` are time evolution operators as prescribed
# in [#nakaji2024]_. The non-identity operators are generated in PennyLane using :class:`~.pennylane.SingleExcitation`
# and :class:`~.pennylane.DoubleExcitation` which then depend on the number of electrons and orbitals 
# of the molecule.

# Defining the energy function
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# In PennyLane, we define the energy function :math:`E = \mbox{Tr}(\hat{H}U_{j_N}\cdots U_{j_1}\rho_0 U_{j_1}^{\dagger}\cdots U_{j_N}^{\dagger})`
# corresponding to Eq. 1 of [#nakaji2024]_. Here, ``energy_circuit`` takes in the operator sequence :math:`U_{j_1}, U_{j_2}, ..., U_{j_N}`
# and returns the energy of the corresponding quantum state.
#
# As a slight extension, we can also calculate the energies for each subsequence of
# operators to help with the training of the model. That is, for a sequence of three operators
# :math:`U_{j_1}, U_{j_2}, U_{j_3}` we compute the energies for :math:`U_{j_1}` and :math:`U_{j_1}, U_{j_2}` instead of just
# the full sequence of three operators, which was described in [#nakaji2024]_. This can be done simply in PennyLane, using 
# :class:`~.pennylane.Snapshot` as shown below.

# Token sequence generation with corresponding energies
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# With these ingredients, we can now construct a dataset containing sequences of tokens and their energies. 
# Since we cannot feed the operators directly to the GPT model, we would need to tokenize
# them. The indices of ``op_pool`` seems to be a good candidate, but we instead choose the tokens to be
# the ``op_pool`` indices shifted by 1. This is so that we can define a special token ``0`` that tells
# the GPT model where the sequence starts.
# 
# We generate a ``train_size`` number of random operator sequences of length ``seq_len`` for our
# purposes and calculate their energies (and their subsequences).
# 

# Generate sequence of indices of operators in vocab

# GPT model implementation details
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# The GPT model we will use in this demo is mostly implemented in the `nanoGPT repo
# <https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT>`__ (a reimplementation of the `OpenAI GPT-2 <https://github.com/openai/gpt-2>`__) as the 
# `class <https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT/blob/9755682b981a45507f6eb9b11eadef8cb83cebd5/model.py#L118>`__

# `dataclass <https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT/blob/9755682b981a45507f6eb9b11eadef8cb83cebd5/model.py#L109>`__ 
# ``GPTConfig``. Namely, we will use 12 attention layers, 12 attention heads, and 768 embedding dimensions, 
# which are equal to those described in [#nakaji2024]_. 
# We can import from the nanoGPT repo directly by running the ``curl`` command (commented out below) in a Jupyter Notebook.
# Since nanoGPT is trained as a language model, its loss function and sampling method are 
# defined differently. We then define the subclass ``GPTQE`` below to override some nanoGPT methods in order to make it more
# suitable for our case.

# However, it is important to note that the loss function ``calculate_loss``, that we defined is different from the one
# described in [#nakaji2024]_ which is :math:`(\exp(-w_{\mbox{sum}}) - \exp(-E))^2`. As described
# beforehand, we instead directly compute the mean squared error between :math:`w_{\mbox{sum}}` and :math:`E`.
# Since the exponential function is one-to-one, both loss functions would then impose the same minimum. 
# Using the error between exponentials may even  
# introduce numerical instabilities in the training since the loss would be taking differences of potentially large numbers.
# In addition to this change from [#nakaji2024]_, we also use the error between the cumulative sum of logits and the corresponding energy
# for each subsequence instead of just the error between total logits and the energy of an entire sequence. 
# This addition will give more training data to the model and should help with logit matching the intermediate tokens.
#
# Since it was not explicitly shown in [#nakaji2024]_, another possible deviation we made is with the logit calculation during offline training. 
# It seems that the logits were accumulated by looping through the sequential generation of tokens. 
# In order to fill in the blanks, we implement the logit calculation in a manner that we think is efficient.
# Namely, we directly pass the fixed training sequences to the model and retrieve the relevant logits from it.
# This can be done because we are using a causal mask for the attention blocks so that the logits of the earlier tokens in the sequence are 
# not affected by tokens in the later part of the sequence. Thus, having the same effect of the sequential token generation.
# 
# We initialize our GPT model below and we see that it has around 85 million parameters. When saved, the model is ``324.25 MB`` in size.

# With a preliminary look at the training logs above, we see that the offline training took 2 h and 12 min for 10,000 
# training iterations. The code execution time was measured by including the ``%%time`` magic command before the code block. 
# We also note that the mean absolute error between the predicted and true energies for the 
# generated sequences quickly became smaller during the earlier parts of the training but fluctuates more 
# later on. As mentioned earlier, a model version is saved each time we get better performance. The best model version is then 
# saved at the 7,000th iteration, where the mean absolute error is at its lowest. The other quantities we observe are the
# average true energies of the generated sequences. It is then promising to see that throughout training, this is
# close to the ground state energy ``grd_E=-1.1372633205048763 Ha``.

# GPT-QE results
# -----------------
# Having finished the offline training, let's take a look at some of our results.

######################################################################
# Training loss curve
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# One of the first things we can look at is the training loss curve. Recall that for our case, the 
# loss is the mean squared error between the cumulative sum of logits (predicted subsequence energies) and their
# corresponding true subsequence energies. So reducing this quantity allows the model to be better at giving 
# correct energies and in turn, correctly sample sequences with lower energies. Since the raw loss values 
# become very small, we instead plot the loss in log-scale below to magnify the loss trend.  
#

#    Figure 3: The subsequence loss for each training iteration

##############################################################################
# We see in Figure 3 that the loss
# continues to decrease until around the 4,000th iteration. There, the model was erroraneous but is quick
# to recover as training continues. This may signal that the GPT model started focusing on learning something
# erroraneous too quickly. So, more regularization noise (like ``dropout``) may be needed to help avoid this. 

######################################################################
# Evaluation progress
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# We now track the performance of the GPT model throughout its training in Figure 4 below. As mentioned
# before, after every 500th iteration, we let the model generate a batch of sequences. Alongside, we
# also return the total logits (predicted energies) used in the sequence generation. In Figure 4,
# the average predicted energies correspond to the red markers and the distribution of predicted
# energies is represented by the red area. Once we have the generated sequences, we can also let PennyLane calculate the true sequence
# energies. Similarly then, the blue markers are the average true energies and the blue
# area represents the true energy distribution.

#    Figure 4: True and predicted energies for sequences generated by the GPT model for each 500th training iteration

##############################################################################
# We now see that the energies predicted by the model improve in accuracy, aligning more closely with the true
# energies during training. The increase in accuracy then allows the model to correctly sample states 
# with lower energies. This is supported in Figure 4 where the sampled true energies 
# get closer to the ground state energy (the dashed line).
# 
# Note that at around the 4,000th iteration, the predicted energies are very far from the true energies.
# This makes sense considering our observation in Figure 3. Also note that at the 7,000th
# iteration, the averages of the predicted and true energies are the closest and even their respective
# spreads seem to have good overlap. This is when the best performing model version was saved, as seen in the training logs. 
# For later iterations however, the predicted energies no longer improved.
# This may indicate that the GPT model has started overfitting on the training dataset in the later iterations. 
# That is, the model became great at predicting the correct energies for the training set (as observed by the decreasing
# loss in Figure 3) but not great at generalizing on those outside the training set (like the sequences that the model
# generated on its own). One solution to avoid overfitting could then be online training. This is so that 
# the GPT model is not restricted on a fixed dataset on which to overfit.

# Sequence generation comparison

# 
# Here, we compare some statistics of the true energies corresponding to sequences generated
# by a "random" model, the latest version of the model after all the training iterations, and the best model version
# saved based on the mean absolute error between the true and predicted energies during training 
# (for our case, this is the model saved at the 7,000th iteration).
# Note that we consider the training set to be generated by a random model since the token
# sequences are just sampled uniformly.

# We observe that the minimum energy corresponding to the random training set is already close
# to the ground state energy ``grd_E=-1.1372633205048763 Ha`` with an error of around ``2.81e-04 Ha``. But we notice that the maximum energy
# is relatively far so the random sequences give a wider spread of energies.
# 
# The energies of the generated sequences from the latest and the best GPT model versions however have a narrower spread and so,
# the average and the minimum energies are very close to ``grd_E``, closer than those in the random 
# training set. Namely, around a ``2.25e-04 Ha`` error for the minimum energy generated by the latest model version
# and a ``7.71e-07 Ha`` error for the best model version. It is then very interesting that
# a well-trained GPT model can generate sequences that are better than those in the training set, even though every
# sequence the model has seen just came from that set. That is, the model was able to generalize. 
# 
# Between the two GPT model versions, we see that the latest version is worse than the best version. The minimum energy
# error for the latest version has the same order of magnitude as the corresponding one for the random training set.
# Contrast this with the minimum energy error for the best version, which is 3 orders of magnitude smaller.
# This behavior is supported by our observation in Figure 4 where the performance of the model after
# the 7,000th iteration worsened. That is, the predicted energies started to deviate further from the true energies
# which in turn caused the states being sampled from these predicted energies to be different from the intended 
# lower energy states.
# 

######################################################################
# Conclusion
# -------------
# 
# In this demo, we see that GPT-QE is a viable alternative in estimating the ground-state energy 
# of a hydrogen molecule. The best underlying GPT model version can generate a state whose energy is 
# only around ``7.71e-07 Ha`` away from ground state energy, which is well below the chemical accuracy. Additionally, since the GPT model being optimized 
# is completely detached from the quantum simulations, gradients across a potentially large quantum circuit
# don't need to be computed, for example. Thus, the machinery of classical ML can be harnessed without 
# worrying too much about the quantum algorithm side of the problem.
# 
# The reader can also experiment with other molecules from PennyLane and tweak several hyperparameters
# of the GPT model (like ``dropout``, and ``n_layer``) and include standard ML callbacks to its training
# (like an early stopping mechanism and a learning rate schedule). The code itself is also open to further 
# optimization. For instance, using `PennyLane Lightning <https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/lightning/en/stable/index.html>`__ 
# to evaluate the energies faster. An online training loop can also be implemented similarly to our offline
# version, the reader would just need to sample sequences from the current GPT model instead of a fixed
# dataset for each training iteration. To facilitate exploration and exploitation, one would also define
# a schedule for the inverse temperature. That is, initially letting the GPT model sample more randomly through
# a high temperature, then gradually decreasing so that the GPT model focuses more on the higher probability
# states (low energies).

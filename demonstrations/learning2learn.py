In this demo we recreate the architecture proposed
in *Learning to learn with quantum neural networks via
classical neural networks* [#l2l]_, using **PennyLane** and **TensorFlow**.
We use classical recurrent neural networks to assist
the optimization of variational quantum algorithms.

We start with a brief theoretical overview explaining the problem
and the setup used to solve it. After that, we deep dive into the
code to build a fully functioning model, ready to be further developed
or customized for your own needs. Without further ado, let’s begin!


Problem: Optimization of Variational Quantum Algorithms
-------------------------------------------------------

Recently, a big effort by the quantum computing community has been
devoted to the study of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs)
which leverage quantum circuits with fixed shape and tunable
parameters. The idea is similar to
classical neural networks, where the weights of the network are
optimized during training. Similarly, once the shape of the variational quantum
circuit is chosen — something that is very difficult and sensitive to
the particular task at hand — its tunable parameters are optimized
iteratively by minimizing a cost (or loss) function, which measures how
good the quantum algorithm is performing (see [#vqas]_ for a
thorough overview on VQAs).

A major challenge for VQAs relates to the optimization of tunable
parameters, which was shown to be a very hard task [#barren]_, [#vqas]_ .
Parameter initialization plays a key role in this scenario,
since initializing the parameters in the proximity of an optimal
solution leads to faster convergence and better results. Thus, a good initialization
strategy is crucial to promote the convergence of local optimizers to
local extrema and to select reasonably good local minima. By local
optimizer, we mean a procedure that moves from one solution to another
by small (local) changes in parameter space. These are opposed to global
search methods, which take into account large sections of
parameter space to propose a new solution.

One such strategy could come from the classical machine learning
literature.

Solution: Classical Recurrent Neural Networks
------------------------------------------------------------------

By building on results from the *meta-learning* literature in machine learning,
authors in [#l2l]_ propose to use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
as a black-box controller to optimize the parameters of
variational quantum algorithms, as shown in the figure below. The cost
function used is the expectation value :math:`\langle H \rangle_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} = \langle \psi_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} | H | \psi_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\rangle`
of a Hamiltonian :math:`H` with respect to the parametrized state
:math:`|\psi_\boldsymbol{\theta}\rangle` evolved by applying the variational quantum circuit to the zero state :math:`|00\cdots0\rangle`.

.. figure:: ../demonstrations/learning2learn/HybridLSTM.png
    :align: center
    :width: 100%

Given parameters :math:`\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t-1}` of the variational quantum circuit,
the cost function :math:`y_{t-1}`, and the hidden state of the
classical network :math:`\boldsymbol{h}_{t-1}` at the previous time step, the
recurrent neural network proposes a new
guess for the parameters :math:`\boldsymbol{\theta}_t`, which are
then fed into the quantum computer to evaluate the
cost function :math:`y_t`. By repeating this cycle a few times, and
by training the weights of the recurrent neural network to minimize
the loss function :math:`y_t`, a good initialization heuristic is
found for the parameters :math:`\boldsymbol{\theta}` of the variational
quantum circuit.

At a given iteration, the RNN receives as input the previous cost
function :math:`y_t` evaluated on the quantum computer, where
:math:`y_t` is the estimate of :math:`\langle H\rangle_{t}`, as well as
the parameters :math:`\boldsymbol{\theta}_t` for which the variational
circuit was evaluated. The RNN at this time step also receives
information stored in its internal hidden state from the previous time
step :math:`\boldsymbol{h}_t`. The RNN itself has trainable parameters :math:`\phi`,
and hence it applies the parametrized mapping:

.. math::  \boldsymbol{h}_{t+1}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1} = \text{RNN}_{\phi}(\boldsymbol{h}_{t}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t}, y_{t}),

which generates a new suggestion for the variational parameters as well
as a new internal state.
Upon training the weights :math:`\phi`, the RNN
eventually learns a good heuristic to suggest optimal parameters for the
quantum circuit.

Thus, by training on a dataset of graphs, the RNN can subsequently be used to
provide suggestions for starting points on new graphs! We are not directly optimizing the variational parameters of
the quantum circuit, but instead, we let the RNN figure out how to do that.
In this sense, we are learning (training the RNN) how to learn (how to optimize a variational quantum circuit).


**VQAs in focus: QAOA for MaxCut**

There are multiple VQAs for which this hybrid training routine could
be used, some of them directly analyzed in [#l2l]_. In the
following, we focus on one such example, the
Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for solving
the MaxCut problem [#maxcutwiki]_. Thus, referring to the picture above,
the shape of the variational circuit is the one dictated by the QAOA
ansatz, and such a quantum circuit is used to evaluate the cost
Hamiltonian :math:`H` of the MaxCut problem.
Check out this great tutorial on
how to use QAOA for solving graph problems: https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qaoa_intro.html

#   It performs the calculation inside the CPU and evaluates the quantum circuit on the QPU to obtain
#   the loss function for the current parameters.
#
# * ``recurrent_loop``: as the name suggests, it accounts for the creation of the recurrent loop
#   of the model. In particular, it makes consecutive calls to the ``rnn_iteration`` function,
#   where the outputs of a previous call are fed as inputs of the next call.

######################################################################
# **The cost function**
#
#
# A key part in the ``recurrent_loop`` function is given by the
# definition of the variable ``loss``. In order to drive the learning
# procedure of the weights in the LSTM cell, a cost function is needed.
# While in the original paper the authors suggest using a measure called
# *observed improvement*, for simplicity here we use an easier cost
# function :math:`\cal{L}(\phi)` defined as:
#
# .. math:: \cal{L}(\phi) = {\bf w} \cdot {\bf y}_t(\phi),
#
# where :math:`{\bf y}_t(\phi) = (y_1, \cdots, y_5)` contains the
# Hamiltonian cost functions from all iterations, and :math:`{\bf w}` are
# just some coefficients weighting the different steps in the recurrent
# loop. In this case, we used :math:`{\bf w}=\frac{1}{5} (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5)`,
# to give more importance to the last steps rather than the initial steps.
# Intuitively in this way the RNN is more free (low coefficient) to
# explore a larger portion of parameter space during the first steps of
# optimization, while it is constrained (high coefficient) to select an
# optimal solution towards the end of the procedure. Note that one could
# also use just the final cost function from the last iteration to drive
# the training procedure of the RNN. However, using values also from
# intermediate steps allows for a smoother suggestion routine, since even
# non-optimal parameter suggestions from early steps are penalized using
# :math:`\cal{L}(\phi)`.

# That’s remarkable! The RNN learned to propose new parameters such that

# *Hurray!* 🎉🎉
#
# As is clear from the picture, the RNN reaches a better minimum in
# fewer iterations than the standard SGD.
# Thus, as the authors suggest, the trained RNN can
# be used for a few iterations at the start of the training procedure to
# initialize the parameters of the quantum circuit close to an optimal
# solution. Then, a standard optimizer like the SGD can be used to
# fine-tune the proposed parameters and reach even better solutions.
# While on this small scale example the benefits of using an LSTM to
# initialize parameters may seem modest, on more complicated instances
# and problems it can make a big difference, since, on random
# initialization of the parameters, standard local optimizer may
# encounter problems finding a good minimization direction (for further
# details, see [#l2l]_, [#vqas]_).
#


######################################################################
# Final remarks
# -----------------
#
# In this demo, we saw how to use a recurrent neural network
# as a black-box optimizer to initialize the parameters in
# a variational quantum circuit close to an optimal solution.
# We connected MaxCut QAOA quantum circuits in PennyLane
# with an LSTM built with TensorFlow, and we used a custom hybrid training
# routine to optimize the whole network.
#
# Such architecture proved itself to be a good candidate for the
# initialization problem of Variational Quantum Algorithms, since it
# reaches good optimal solutions in very few iterations. Besides, the
# architecture is quite general since the same machinery can be used for
# graphs having a generic number of nodes (see "Generalization Performances"
# in the Appendix).
#
# **What’s next?**
#
#
# But the story does not end here. There are multiple ways this work could
# be improved. Here are a few:
#
# *  Use the proposed architecture for VQAs other than QAOA for MaxCut.
#    You can check the paper [#l2l]_ to get some inspiration.
# *  Scale up the simulation, using bigger graphs and longer recurrent
#    loops.
# *  While working correctly, the training routine is quite basic and it
#    could be improved for example by implementing batch learning or a
#    stopping criterion. Also, one could implement the
#    *observed improvement* loss function, as used in the original paper
#    [#l2l]_.
# *  Depending on the problem, you may wish to transform the functions
#    ``rnn_iteration`` and ``recurrent_loop`` to actual ``Keras Layers``
#    and ``Models``. This way, by compiling the model before the training
#    takes place, ``TensorFlow`` can create the computational graph of the
#    model and train more efficiently. You can find
#    some ideas below to start working on it.
#
# If you're interested, in the Appendix below you can find some more details
# and insights about this model. Go check it out!
#
# If you have any doubt, or wish to discuss about the project don’t
# hesitate to contact me, I’ll be very happy to help you as much as I can
# 😁
#
# Have a great quantum day!

# introduced in this tutorial.
#
# Generalization performances
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# A very interesting feature of this model, is that it can be
# straightforwardly applied to graphs having a different number of nodes. In
# fact, until now our analysis focused only on graphs with the same number
# of nodes for ease of explanation, and there is no actual restriction in
# this respect. The same machinery works fine for any graph, since the
# number of QAOA parameters are only dependent on the number of layers in
# the ansatz, and not on the number of qubits (equal to the number of
# nodes in the graph) in the quantum circuit.
#
# Thus, we might want to challenge our model to learn a good
# initialization heuristic for a non-specific graph, with an arbitrary
# number of nodes. For this purpose, let’s create a training dataset
# containing graphs with a different number of nodes :math:`n`, taken in
# the interval :math:`n \in [7,9]` (that is, our dataset now contains
# graphs having either 7, 8 and 9 nodes).
#

g7 = generate_graphs(5, 7, 3 / 7)
g8 = generate_graphs(5, 8, 3 / 7)

gs_cost_list = [qaoa_from_graph(g) for g in gs]

# .. note::
#     This code works only for a single graph at a time, since a graph was
#     needed to create the ``QRNN`` ``Keras Layer`` named ``rnn0``. Thus, in
#     order to actually train the RNN network for multiple graphs, the above
#     training routine must be modified. Otherwise, you could find a way to
#     define the model to accept as input a whole dataset of graphs, and not
#     just a single one. Still, this might prove particularly hard, since
#     TensorFlow deals with tensors, and is not able to directly manage
#     other data structures, like graphs or functions taking graphs as
#     input, like ``qaoa_from_graph``.

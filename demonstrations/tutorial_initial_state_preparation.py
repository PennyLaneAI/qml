    tutorial_vqe A brief overview of VQE

*Author: Stepan Fomichev â€” Posted: 20 October 2023. Last updated: 20 October 2023.*

A high-quality initial state can significantly reduce the runtime of many quantum algorithms. From
the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) to quantum phase estimation (QPE) and even the recent
`intermediate-scale quantum (ISQ) <https://pennylane.ai/blog/2023/06/from-nisq-to-isq/>`_ algorithms, obtaining the ground state of a chemical system requires
a good initial state. For instance, in the case of VQE, a good initial state directly translates into fewer
optimization steps. In QPE, the probability of measuring the ground-state energy is directly
proportional to the overlap squared of the initial and ground states. Even beyond quantum phase estimation,
good initial guesses are important for algorithms like quantum approximate optimization (QAOA)
and Grover search.

Much like searching for a needle in a haystack, there are a lot of things you might try 
to prepare a good guess for the ground state in the large-dimensional Hilbert space. In this
tutorial, we show how to use traditional computational chemistry techniques to
get us *most of the way* to an initial state. Such an initial state will not be the
ground state, but it will certainly be better than the standard guess of a computational 
basis state :math:`\ket{0}^{\otimes N}` or the Hartree-Fock state.

Importing initial states
------------------------
We can import initial states obtained from several post-Hartree-Fock quantum chemistry calculations
to PennyLane. These methods are incredibly diverse in terms of their outputs, not always returning
an object that can be turned into a PennyLane state vector. We have already done this hard
conversion work: all that you need to do is run these methods and pass their outputs
to PennyLane's :func:`~.pennylane.qchem.import_state` function. The currently supported methods are
configuration interaction with singles and doubles (CISD), coupled cluster (CCSD), density-matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) and semistochastic heat-bath configuration interaction (SHCI).

CISD states
^^^^^^^^^^^
The first line of attack for initial state preparation are CISD calculations performed with the `PySCF <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf>`_
library. CISD is unsophisticated, but fast. It will not be of much help for strongly correlated molecules,
but it is better than Hartree-Fock. Here is the code example based on the restricted Hartree-Fock
orbitals, but the unrestricted version is available too.
"""

from pyscf import gto, scf, ci
from pennylane.qchem import import_state

R = 1.2
# create the H3+ molecule
mol = gto.M(atom=[['H', (0, 0, 0)], ['H', (0,0,R)], ['H', (0,0,2*R)]],\
                            charge=1, basis='sto-3g')
# perfrom restricted Hartree-Fock and then CISD
myhf = scf.RHF(mol).run()
myci = ci.CISD(myhf).run()
wf_cisd = import_state(myci, tol=1e-1)
print(f"CISD-based state vector\n{wf_cisd}")

##############################################################################
# The final object, PennyLane's state vector ``wf_cisd``, is ready to be used as an 
# initial state in a quantum circuit in PennyLane--we will showcase this below for VQE.
# Conversion for CISD is straightforward: simply assign the PySCF-stored CI coefficients 
# to appropriate determinants.
#
# The second attribute, ``tol``, specifies the cutoff beyond which contributions to the 
# wavefunctions are neglected. Internally, wavefunctions are stored in their Slater 
# determinant representation, and if their prefactor coefficient is below ``tol``, those 
# determinants are dropped from the expression.
#
#
# CCSD states
# ^^^^^^^^^^^
# The function :func:`~.pennylane.qchem.import_state` is general, and can automatically detect the input type
# and apply the appropriate conversion protocol. It works similarly to the above for CCSD.

from pyscf import cc
mycc = cc.CCSD(myhf).run()
wf_ccsd = import_state(mycc, tol=1e-1)
print(f"CCSD-based state vector\n{wf_ccsd}")

# For CCSD conversion, the exponential form is expanded and terms are collected to 
# second order to obtain the CI coefficients. 
#
# DMRG states
# ^^^^^^^^^^^
# The DMRG calculations involve running the library `Block2 <https://github.com/block-hczhai/block2-preview>`_,

#
# .. code-block:: bash

# The crucial part is calling ``get_csf_coefficients()`` on the solution stored in 
# MPS form in the ``ket``. This triggers an internal reconstruction calculation that
# converts the MPS to the sum of Slater determinants form, returning the output 
# as a tuple ``(list([int]), array(float]))``. The first element expresses a given Slater
# determinant using Fock occupation vectors of length equal to the number of spatial
# orbitals in Block2 notation, where ``0`` is unoccupied, ``1`` is occupied with spin-up 
# electron, ``2`` is occupied with spin-down, and ``3`` is doubly occupied. The first 
# element must be converted to ``list`` for ``import_state`` to accept it. The second 
# element stores the CI coefficients. 
#
# In principle, this functionality can be used to generate any initial state, provided 
# the user specifies a list of Slater determinants and their coefficients in this form. 
# Let's take this opportunity to create the Hartree-Fock initial state, to compare the 
# other states against it.

How do initial states affect quantum algorithms?
------------------------------------------------
From the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) to quantum phase estimation (QPE), to even 
the recent ISQ-era algorithms like the Lin-Tong approach, many quantum algorithms for 
obtaining the ground state of a chemical system require a good initial state to be 
useful. (add three images here)

In the case of VQE, as we will see later in this demo, a good initial state directly 
translates into fewer optimization steps. In QPE, for an initial state 
:math:`\ket{\psi_{\text{in}}}` written in terms of the eigenstates $\{\ket{\psi_n}\}$ 
of the system Hamiltonian

.. math::

    \ket{\psi_{\text{in}}} = c_0 \ket{\psi_0} + c_1 \ket{\psi_1} + ...

the probability of measuring the ground-state energy is directly proportional to the 
overlap squared $|c_0|^2$ of the initial and ground states. Finally, in Lin-Tong, the 
overlap with the ground-state affects the size of the step in the cumulative 
distribution function. A bigger step makes it easier to detect the jump with fewer 
circuit samples, and thus resolve the position of the ground-state energy. Even beyond 
quantum phase estimation, good initial guesses are important for algorithms like 
quantum approximate optimization (QAOA) and Grover search.

To summarize, having a high-quality initial state can seriously reduce the runtime 
of many quantum algorithms. By high-quality, we just mean that the prepared 
state in some sense minimizes the effort of the quantum algorithm.

Where to get good initial states?
-----------------------------------
Much like searching for a needle in a haystack, there are a lot of things you might try 
to prepare a good guess for the ground-state in the large-dimensional Hilbert space. 

Seeing as we are already using a quantum computer, we could turn to a quantum algorithm 
to do the job -- this is the domain of quantum heuristics. The most famous idea is the 
adiabatic state preparation approach, but there are others like quantum imaginary-time 
evolution (QITE) and variational methods (for example, VQE). Unfortunately, these 
methods are typically similarly limited by a) long runtimes, or b) the need for 
expensive classical optimization, and c) provide no performance guarantees.

On the other hand, we could rely on traditional computational chemistry techniques to 
get us _most of the way_ to an initial state. We could run a method like configuration 
interaction with singles and doubles (CISD), or coupled cluster (CCSD), take the result 
and implement it on the quantum computer. Such an initial state will not be the 
ground-state, but it will certainly be better than the standard guess of a computational 
basis state :math:`\ket{0}^{\otimes N}` or the Hartree-Fock state. 

It is this second approach that we focus on in this demo.

Importing initial states into PennyLane
---------------------------------------
The current version of PennyLane can import initial states from the following methods

    1. Configuration interaction with singles and doubles (CISD) from PySCF
        The first line of attack for state prep, CISD is unsophisticated but fast. 
        It will not be much help for strongly correlated molecules, but it is better 
        than Hartree-Fock.
    2. Coupled cluster with singles and doubles (CCSD) from PySCF
        In our implementation, we reconstruct the CCSD wavefunction to second order,
        making it a marginal improvement on the CISD approach.
    3. Density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), from the Block2 library
        A powerful method based on matrix-product states, DMRG is considered state of the
        art for quantum chemistry simulations, capable of handling reasonably large 
        systems (100-140 spin orbitals) and strongly correlated molecules.
    4. Semistochastic heat-bath configuration interaction (SHCI), from the Dice library
        A member of the selective configuration interaction family of methods, SHCI is 
        right there with DMRG in terms of accuracy and speed, and often used alongside it 
        as a cross-check. 

These methods are incredibly diverse in terms of their outputs, not always returning an 
object that can be turned into a PennyLane statevector. We have already done this hard 
work of conversion: all that you need to do is run these methods and pass their outputs 
to PennyLane's `import_state`. 

Here is how to do this for CISD / CCSD methods via PySCF: we show the version based on 
the restricted Hartree-Fock orbitals, but the unrestricted versions are available too.

# determinant using Fock occupation vectors of length equal to the number of spatial
# orbitals in Block2 notation, where `0` is unoccupied, `1` is occupied with spin-up 
# electron, `2` is occupied with spin-down, and `3` is doubly occupied. The first 
# element must be converted to `list` for `import_state` to accept it. The second

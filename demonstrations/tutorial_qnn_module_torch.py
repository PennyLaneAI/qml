*Author: Tom Bromley — Posted: 02 November 2020. Last updated: 28 January 2021.*

Creating neural networks in `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`__ is easy using the
`nn module <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html>`__. Models are constructed from elementary
*layers* and can be trained using the PyTorch API. For example, the following code defines a
two-layer network that could be used for binary classification:
"""

import torch

layer_1 = torch.nn.Linear(2, 2)
layer_2 = torch.nn.Linear(2, 2)
softmax = torch.nn.Softmax(dim=1)

layers = [layer_1, layer_2, softmax]
model = torch.nn.Sequential(*layers)

# **What if we want to add a quantum layer to our model?** This is possible in PennyLane:
# :doc:`QNodes <../glossary/hybrid_computation>` can be converted into ``torch.nn`` layers and
# combined with the wide range of built-in classical
# `layers <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html>`__ to create truly hybrid
# models. This tutorial will guide you through a simple example to show you how it's done!
#
# .. note::
#
#     A similar demo explaining how to
#     :doc:`turn quantum nodes into Keras layers <tutorial_qnn_module_tf>`
#     is also available.
#
# Fixing the dataset and problem
# ------------------------------
#
# Let us begin by choosing a simple dataset and problem to allow us to focus on how the hybrid
# model is constructed. Our objective is to classify points generated from scikit-learn's
# binary-class
# `make_moons() <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_moons.html>`__ dataset:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import make_moons

# Set random seeds
torch.manual_seed(42)
np.random.seed(42)

X, y = make_moons(n_samples=200, noise=0.1)
y_ = torch.unsqueeze(torch.tensor(y), 1)  # used for one-hot encoded labels
y_hot = torch.scatter(torch.zeros((200, 2)), 1, y_, 1)

c = ["#1f77b4" if y_ == 0 else "#ff7f0e" for y_ in y]  # colours for each class
plt.axis("off")
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=c)
plt.show()

# Defining a QNode
# ----------------
#
# Our next step is to define the QNode that we want to interface with ``torch.nn``. Any
# combination of device, operations and measurements that is valid in PennyLane can be used to
# compose the QNode. However, the QNode arguments must satisfy additional :doc:`conditions
# <code/api/pennylane.qnn.TorchLayer>` including having an argument called ``inputs``. All other
# arguments must be arrays or tensors and are treated as trainable weights in the model. We fix a
# two-qubit QNode using the
# :doc:`default.qubit <code/api/pennylane.devices.default_qubit.DefaultQubit>` simulator and
# operations from the :doc:`templates <introduction/templates>` module.

import pennylane as qml

n_qubits = 2
dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=n_qubits)

@qml.qnode(dev)
def qnode(inputs, weights):
    qml.AngleEmbedding(inputs, wires=range(n_qubits))
    qml.BasicEntanglerLayers(weights, wires=range(n_qubits))
    return [qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wires=i)) for i in range(n_qubits)]

###############################################################################
# Interfacing with Torch
# ----------------------
#
# With the QNode defined, we are ready to interface with ``torch.nn``. This is achieved using the
# :class:`~pennylane.qnn.TorchLayer` class of the :mod:`~pennylane.qnn` module, which converts the
# QNode to the elementary building block of ``torch.nn``: a *layer*. We shall see in the
# following how the resultant layer can be combined with other well-known neural network layers
# to form a hybrid model.
#
# We must first define the ``weight_shapes`` dictionary. Recall that all of
# the arguments of the QNode (except the one named ``inputs``) are treated as trainable
# weights. For the QNode to be successfully converted to a layer in ``torch.nn``, we need to provide
# the details of the shape of each trainable weight for them to be initialized. The
# ``weight_shapes`` dictionary maps from the argument names of the QNode to corresponding shapes:

n_layers = 6
weight_shapes = {"weights": (n_layers, n_qubits)}

###############################################################################
# In our example, the ``weights`` argument of the QNode is trainable and has shape given by
# ``(n_layers, n_qubits)``, which is passed to
# :func:`~pennylane.templates.layers.BasicEntanglerLayers`.
#
# Now that ``weight_shapes`` is defined, it is easy to then convert the QNode:

qlayer = qml.qnn.TorchLayer(qnode, weight_shapes)

###############################################################################
# With this done, the QNode can now be treated just like any other ``torch.nn`` layer and we can
# proceed using the familiar Torch workflow.
#
# Creating a hybrid model
# -----------------------
#
# Let's create a basic three-layered hybrid model consisting of:
#
# 1. a 2-neuron fully connected classical layer
# 2. our 2-qubit QNode converted into a layer
# 3. another 2-neuron fully connected classical layer
# 4. a softmax activation to convert to a probability vector
#
# A diagram of the model can be seen in the figure below.
#
# .. figure:: /demonstrations/qnn_module/qnn_torch.png
#    :width: 100%
#    :align: center
#
# We can construct the model using the
# `Sequential <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Sequential.html>`__ API:

clayer_1 = torch.nn.Linear(2, 2)
clayer_2 = torch.nn.Linear(2, 2)
softmax = torch.nn.Softmax(dim=1)
layers = [clayer_1, qlayer, clayer_2, softmax]
model = torch.nn.Sequential(*layers)

###############################################################################
# Training the model
# ------------------
#
# We can now train our hybrid model on the classification dataset using the usual Torch
# approach. We'll use the
# standard `SGD <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#torch.optim.SGD>`__ optimizer
# and the mean absolute error loss function:

opt = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.2)
loss = torch.nn.L1Loss()

###############################################################################
# Note that there are more advanced combinations of optimizer and loss function, but here we are
# focusing on the basics.
#
# The model is now ready to be trained!

X = torch.tensor(X, requires_grad=True).float()
y_hot = y_hot.float()

batch_size = 5
batches = 200 // batch_size

data_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
    list(zip(X, y_hot)), batch_size=5, shuffle=True, drop_last=True
)

epochs = 6

for epoch in range(epochs):

    running_loss = 0

    for xs, ys in data_loader:
        opt.zero_grad()

        loss_evaluated = loss(model(xs), ys)
        loss_evaluated.backward()

        opt.step()

        running_loss += loss_evaluated

    avg_loss = running_loss / batches
    print("Average loss over epoch {}: {:.4f}".format(epoch + 1, avg_loss))

y_pred = model(X)
predictions = torch.argmax(y_pred, axis=1).detach().numpy()

correct = [1 if p == p_true else 0 for p, p_true in zip(predictions, y)]
accuracy = sum(correct) / len(correct)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100}%")

###############################################################################
# How did we do? The model looks to have successfully trained and the accuracy is reasonably
# high. In practice, we would aim to push the accuracy higher by thinking carefully about the
# model design and the choice of hyperparameters such as the learning rate.
#
# Creating non-sequential models
# ------------------------------
#
# The model we created above was composed of a sequence of classical and quantum layers. This
# type of model is very common and is suitable in a lot of situations. However, in some cases we
# may want a greater degree of control over how the model is constructed, for example when we
# have multiple inputs and outputs or when we want to distribute the output of one layer into
# multiple subsequent layers.
#
# Suppose we want to make a hybrid model consisting of:
#
# 1. a 4-neuron fully connected classical layer
# 2. a 2-qubit quantum layer connected to the first two neurons of the previous classical layer
# 3. a 2-qubit quantum layer connected to the second two neurons of the previous classical layer
# 4. a 2-neuron fully connected classical layer which takes a 4-dimensional input from the
#    combination of the previous quantum layers
# 5. a softmax activation to convert to a probability vector
#
# A diagram of the model can be seen in the figure below.
#
# .. figure:: /demonstrations/qnn_module/qnn2_torch.png
#    :width: 100%
#    :align: center
#
# This model can also be constructed by creating a new class that inherits from the
# ``torch.nn`` `Module <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module>`__ and
# overriding the ``forward()`` method:

class HybridModel(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.clayer_1 = torch.nn.Linear(2, 4)
        self.qlayer_1 = qml.qnn.TorchLayer(qnode, weight_shapes)
        self.qlayer_2 = qml.qnn.TorchLayer(qnode, weight_shapes)
        self.clayer_2 = torch.nn.Linear(4, 2)
        self.softmax = torch.nn.Softmax(dim=1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.clayer_1(x)
        x_1, x_2 = torch.split(x, 2, dim=1)
        x_1 = self.qlayer_1(x_1)
        x_2 = self.qlayer_2(x_2)
        x = torch.cat([x_1, x_2], axis=1)
        x = self.clayer_2(x)
        return self.softmax(x)

model = HybridModel()

###############################################################################
# As a final step, let's train the model to check if it's working:

opt = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.2)
epochs = 6

for epoch in range(epochs):

    running_loss = 0

    for xs, ys in data_loader:
        opt.zero_grad()

        loss_evaluated = loss(model(xs), ys)
        loss_evaluated.backward()

        opt.step()

        running_loss += loss_evaluated

    avg_loss = running_loss / batches
    print("Average loss over epoch {}: {:.4f}".format(epoch + 1, avg_loss))

y_pred = model(X)
predictions = torch.argmax(y_pred, axis=1).detach().numpy()

correct = [1 if p == p_true else 0 for p, p_true in zip(predictions, y)]
accuracy = sum(correct) / len(correct)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100}%")

Digital zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) with Catalyst
====================================================

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use :doc:`error mitigation <tutorial_error_mitigation>`, and in particular 
the zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) technique, in combination with 
`Catalyst <https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/catalyst>`_, a framework for quantum 
just-in-time (JIT) compilation with PennyLane. 
We'll demonstrate how to generate noise-scaled circuits, execute them on a noisy quantum
simulator, and use extrapolation techniques to estimate the zero-noise result, all while
leveraging JIT compilation through Catalyst.

The demo :doc:`Error mitigation with Mitiq and PennyLane <tutorial_error_mitigation>`
shows how ZNE, along with other error mitigation techniques, can be carried out in PennyLane
by using `Mitiq <https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq>`__, a Python library developed 
by `Unitary Fund <https://unitary.fund/>`__.

ZNE in particular is also offered out of the box in PennyLane as a *differentiable* error mitigation technique,
for usage in combination with variational workflows. More on this in the tutorial
:doc:`Differentiating quantum error mitigation transforms <tutorial_diffable-mitigation>`.

On top of the error mitigation routines offered in PennyLane, ZNE is also available for just-in-time
(JIT) compilation. In this tutorial we see how an error mitigation routine can be
integrated in a Catalyst workflow.

At the end of the tutorial, we will compare the execution time of ZNE routines in
pure PennyLane vs. PennyLane and Catalyst with JIT.

What is zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE)
--------------------------------------
Zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) is a technique used to mitigate the effect of noise on quantum
computations. First introduced in [#zne-2017]_, it helps improve the accuracy of quantum
results by running circuits at varying noise levels and extrapolating back to a hypothetical
zero-noise case. While this tutorial won't delve into the theory behind ZNE in detail (for which we
recommend reading the `Mitiq docs <https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/zne-5-theory.html>`_
and the references, including Mitiq's whitepaper [#mitiq-2022]_), let's first review what happens when using the protocol in practice.

Stage 1: Generating noise-scaled circuits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ZNE works by generating circuits with **increased** noise. Catalyst implements the unitary folding
framework introduced in [#dzne-2020]_ for generating noise-scaled circuits. In particular, 
the following two methods are available:

1. **Global folding**: If a circuit implements a global unitary :math:`U`, global folding applies
   :math:`U(U^\dagger U)^n` for some integer :math:`n`,
   effectively scaling the noise in the entire circuit.
2. **Local folding**: Individual gates are repeated (or folded) in contrast with the entire
   circuit.

Stage 2: Running the circuits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once noise-scaled circuits are created, they need to be run! These can be executed on either real
quantum hardware or a noisy quantum simulator. In this tutorial, we'll use the
`Qrack quantum simulator <https://qrack.readthedocs.io/>`_, which is both compatible with Catalyst,
and implements a noise model. For more about the integration of Qrack and Catalyst, see
the demo :doc:`QJIT compilation with Qrack and Catalyst <qrack>`.

Stage 3: Combining the results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After executing the noise-scaled circuits, an extrapolation on the results is performed  
to estimate the zero-noise limit---the result we would expect in a noise-free scenario. 
Catalyst provides **polynomial** and **exponential** extrapolation methods.

These three stages illustrate what happens behind the scenes when using a ZNE routine. 
However, from the user's perspective, one only needs to define the initial circuit, 
the noise scaling method, and the extrapolation method. The rest is taken care of by Catalyst.

Defining the mirror circuit
---------------------------

The first step for demoing an error mitigation routine is to define a circuit. 
Here we build a simple mirror circuit starting off a `unitary 2-design <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_t-design>`__. 
This is a typical construction for a randomized benchmarking circuit, which is used in many tasks
in quantum computing. Given such circuit, we measure the expectation value :math:`\langle Z\rangle` 
on the state of the first qubit, and by construction of the circuit, we expect this value to be
equal to 1.

##############################################################################
# In the noiseless scenario, the expectation value of the Pauli-Z measurement
# is equal to 1, since the first qubit is back in the :math:`|0\rangle` state.
#
# Mitigating the noisy circuit
# ----------------------------
# Let's now run the circuit through a noisy scenario. The Qrack simulator models noise by
# applying single-qubit depolarizing noise channels to all qubits in all gates of the circuit.
# The probability of error is specified by the value of the ``noise`` constructor argument.

##############################################################################
# Again expected, we obtain a noisy value that diverges from the ideal value we obtained above.
# Fortunately, we have error mitigation to the rescue! We can apply ZNE, however we are still
# missing some necessary parameters. In particular we still need to specify:
#
# 1. The method for scaling this noise up (in Catalyst there are two options: ``global`` and
#    ``local``).
# 2. The noise scaling factors (i.e. how much to increase the depth of the circuit).
# 3. The extrapolation technique used to estimate the ideal value (available in Catalyst are
#    polynomial and exponential extrapolation).
#
# First, we choose a method to scale the noise. This needs to be specified as a Python string.

folding_method = "global"

##############################################################################
# Next, we pick a list of scale factors. At the time of writing this tutorial,
# Catalyst supports only odd integer scale factors. In the global folding setting,
# a scale factor  :math:`s` correspond to the circuit being folded
# :math:`\frac{s - 1}{2}` times.
scale_factors = [1, 3, 5]

##############################################################################
# Finally, we'll choose the extrapolation technique. Both exponential and polynomial extrapolation
# is available in the :mod:`qml.transforms <pennylane.transforms>` module, and both of these functions can be passed directly
# into Catalyst's :func:`catalyst.mitigate_with_zne` function. In this tutorial we use polynomial extrapolation,
# which we hypothesize best models the behavior of the noise scenario we are considering.

# to define the node are compatible with Catalyst, and we can therefore

# Benchmarking
# ------------
# For comparison, let's define a very similar :func:`~.qnode`, but this time we don't decorate the node
# as just-in-time compilable.
# When it comes to the parameters, the only difference here (due to an implementation technicality)
# is the type of the ``folding`` argument. Despite the type being different, however,
# the value of the folding method is the same, i.e., global folding.

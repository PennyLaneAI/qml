Until we have fault-tolerant quantum computers, 
we will have to learn to live with noise. There are lots of exciting 
ideas and algorithms in quantum computing and quantum machine learning, 
but how well do they survive the reality of today's noisy devices? 

Background
----------

Quantum pure-state simulators are great and readily available in 
a number of quantum software packages. 
They allow us to experiment, prototype, test, and validate algorithms
and research ideas---up to a certain number of qubits, at least ðŸ˜‰.

But present-day hardware is not ideal. We're forced to confront 
decoherence, bit flips, amplitude damping, and so on. Does the 
presence of noise in near-term devices impact their use in, 
for example, 
:doc:`variational quantum algorithms </glossary/variational_circuit>_`?
Won't our models, trained so carefully in simulators, fall apart 
when we run on noisy devices?

In fact, there is some optimism that variational algorithms may be
the best type of algorithms on near-term devices, and could
have an in-built adaptability to noise that more rigid 
textbook algorithms do not possess. 
Variational algorithms are somewhat robust against the fact 
that the device they are run on may not be ideal. Being variational
in nature, they can be tuned to "work around" noise to some extent. 

Quantum machine learning leverages a lot of tools from its 
classical counterpart. Fortunately, there is great evidence that
machine learning algorithms can not only be robust to noise, but 
can even benefit from it! 
Examples include the use of 
`reduced-precision arithmetic in deep learning <https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3045118.3045303>_`,
the strong performance of
`stochastic gradient descent <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent>`_, 
and the use of "dropout" noise to 
`prevent overfitting <https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/JMLRdropout.pdf>`_. 

With this evidence to motivate us, we can still hope to find, 
extract, and work with the underlying quantum "signal" 
that is influenced by a device's inherent noise. 

Noisy circuits
--------------

Let's consider a simple quantum circuit which performs a standard
quantum information task: the creation of an entangled
state and the measurement of a 
`Bell inequality <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem>`_
(also known as the 
`CHSH inequality <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHSH_inequality>`_).

Since we'll be dealing with noise, we'll need to use a simulator
that supports noise and density-state representations of quantum
states (in contrast to many simulators, which use a pure-state
representation). 

`Cirq <https://cirq.readthedocs.io>`_ provides mixed-state
simulators and noisy operations natively, so we'll use the 
PennyLane-Cirq plugin to carry out our noisy simulations.

# There are a couple interesting observations here. 
#
# First, the noisy circuit isn't able to achieve the same final
# cost function value as the ideal circuit. This is because 
# the noise causes the state to be come irreversibly mixed. 
# Mixed states can't achieve the same extremal expectation values
# as pure states.
#
# The second observation is that both circuits still converge to 
# the _same parameter values_ :math:`(0,\pi)`, despite having 
# different final states. 
#
# It could have been the case that noisy devices irreparably 
# damage the optimization of variational circuits, steering us 
# towards parameter values which are not at all useful. 
# Luckily, at least for the simple example above, this is not the case. 
# Optimizations on noisy devices can still lead to similar parameter 
# values as when we run on ideal devices. 

##############################################################################
# Let's dig a bit into the underlying quantum information theory
# to understand better what's happening.
# Expectation values of :doc:`variational circuits </glossary/variational_circuit>`_, 
# like the one we are measuring, are composed of three pieces:
#
# i) an initial quantum state :math:`\rho` (usually the zero state);
# ii) a parameterized unitary transformation :math:`U(\theta)`); and
# iii) measurement of a final observable :math:`\hat{B}`.
#
# The equation for the expectation value is given by the Born rule:
# ..math::
#
#   \langle \hat{B} \rangle = 
#           \mathrm{Tr}(\hat{B}U(\theta)\rho U^\dagger(\theta)).
#
# When optimizing, we can compute gradients of many common gates 
# using the :doc:`parameter-shift rule </glossary/parameter_shift>`_:
# ..math::
#
#   \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\langle \hat{B} \rangle(\theta)`
#      =  \frac{1}{2}
#            \left[
#                \langle \hat{B} \rangle(\theta + \frac{\pi}{2})
#              - \langle \hat{B} \rangle(\theta)
#            \right]
#
# In our example, the unitary is split into two gates, 
# ``U_1=RX`` and ``U_2=RY``, each of which takes an independent 
# parameter \theta_i. 
# What happens when we apply a 
# noisy channel :math:`\Lambda` after the gates? In this case, 
# the expectation value becomes
#
# ..math::
#
#   \langle \hat{B} \rangle = 
#           \mathrm{Tr}(\hat{B}\Lambda\left[
#                          U(\theta)\rho U^\dagger(\theta)
#                      \right]).
#
# Using the Heisenberg picture, we can transfer the channel 
# \Lambda acting on the state :math:`U(\theta)\rho U^\dagger(\theta)`
# into the _adjoint channel_ :math:`\Lambda^\dagger` acting on the 
# observable :math:`\hat{B}`, transforming it to a new observable
# :math:`\hat{B} = \Lambda^\dagger[\hat{B}]=\hat{B}'`
# With the channel present, the expectation value can be interpreted
# as if we had the same variational state, but measured a different
# observable:
#
# ..math::
#
#   \langle \hat{B} \rangle = 
#           \mathrm{Tr}(\hat{B}'(\theta)\rho U^\dagger(\theta)).
#
# This has immediate consequences for the parameter-shift rule. With
# the channel present, we have simply
#
# ..math::
#
#   \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\langle \hat{B} \rangle(\theta)`
#      =  \frac{1}{2}
#            \left[
#                \langle \hat{B}' \rangle(\theta + \frac{\pi}{2})
#              - \langle \hat{B}' \rangle(\theta)
#            \right].
#
# In other words, the parameter-shift rule continues to hold for all
# gates, even when we add additional channels! 
#
# ..note:: In the above, we implicitly assumed that the channel 
#          is independent of the gate's parameters. 
# 
# 
# Let's confirm the above derivations with our example.

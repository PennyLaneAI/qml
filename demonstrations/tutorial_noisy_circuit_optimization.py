Until we have fault-tolerant quantum computers,
we will have to learn to live with noise. There are lots of exciting
ideas and algorithms in quantum computing and quantum machine learning,
but how well do they survive the reality of today's noisy devices?

Background
----------

Quantum pure-state simulators are great and readily available in
a number of quantum software packages.
They allow us to experiment, prototype, test, and validate algorithms
and research ideas—up to a certain number of qubits, at least.

But present-day hardware is not ideal. We're forced to confront
decoherence, bit flips, amplitude damping, and so on. Does the
presence of noise in near-term devices impact their use in,
for example,
:doc:`variational quantum algorithms </glossary/variational_circuit>`?
Won't our models, trained so carefully in simulators, fall apart
when we run on noisy devices?

In fact, there is some optimism that variational algorithms may be
the best type of algorithms on near-term devices, and could
have an in-built adaptability to noise that more rigid
textbook algorithms do not possess.
Variational algorithms are somewhat robust against the fact
that the device they are run on may not be ideal. Being variational
in nature, they can be tuned to "work around" noise to some extent.

Quantum machine learning leverages a lot of tools from its
classical counterpart. Fortunately, there is great evidence that
machine learning algorithms can not only be robust to noise, but
can even benefit from it!
Examples include the use of
`reduced-precision arithmetic in deep learning <https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3045118.3045303>`_,
the strong performance of
`stochastic gradient descent <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent>`_,
and the use of "dropout" noise to
`prevent overfitting <https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/JMLRdropout.pdf>`_.

With this evidence to motivate us, we can still hope to find,
extract, and work with the underlying quantum "signal"
that is influenced by a device's inherent noise.

Noisy circuits: creating a Bell state
-------------------------------------

Let's consider a simple quantum circuit which performs a standard
quantum information task: the creation of an entangled
state and the measurement of a
`Bell inequality <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem>`_
(also known as the
`CHSH inequality <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHSH_inequality>`_).

Since we'll be dealing with noise, we'll need to use a simulator
that supports noise and density-state representations of quantum
states (in contrast to many simulators, which use a pure-state
representation).

Fortunately, `Cirq <https://cirq.readthedocs.io>`_ provides mixed-state
simulators and noisy operations natively, so we can use the
`PennyLane-Cirq plugin <https://pennylane-cirq.readthedocs.io>`_
to carry out our noisy simulations.

#
#     In Google's quantum supremacy paper [#arute2019]_,

#           gates, followed by the action of a noisy channel. This is a common

# There are a couple interesting observations here:
#
# i) The noisy circuit isn't able to achieve the same final
#    cost function value as the ideal circuit. This is because
#    the noise causes the state to become irreversibly mixed.
#    Mixed states can't achieve the same extremal expectation values
#    as pure states.
#
# ii) However, both circuits still converge to
#     the *same parameter values* :math:`(0,\pi)`, despite having
#     different final states.
#
# It could have been the case that noisy devices irreparably
# damage the optimization of variational circuits, steering us
# towards parameter values which are not at all useful.
# Luckily, at least for the simple example above, this is not the case.
# *Optimizations on noisy devices can still lead to similar parameter
# values as when we run on ideal devices.*

##############################################################################
# Understanding the effect of noisy channels
# ------------------------------------------
#
# Let's dig a bit into the underlying quantum information theory
# to understand better what's happening [#meyer2020]_.
# Expectation values of :doc:`variational circuits </glossary/variational_circuit>`,
# like the one we are measuring, are composed of three pieces:
#
# i) an initial quantum state :math:`\rho` (usually the zero state);
# ii) a parameterized unitary transformation :math:`U(\theta)`); and
# iii) measurement of a final observable :math:`\hat{B}`.
#
# The equation for the expectation value is given by the
# `Born rule <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_rule>`_:
#
# .. math::
#
#   \langle \hat{B} \rangle (\theta) =
#           \mathrm{Tr}(\hat{B}U(\theta)\rho U^\dagger(\theta)).
#
# When optimizing, we can compute gradients of many common gates
# using the :doc:`parameter-shift rule </glossary/parameter_shift>`:
#
# .. math::
#
#   \nabla_\theta\langle \hat{B} \rangle(\theta)
#      =  \frac{1}{2}
#            \left[
#                \langle \hat{B} \rangle\left(\theta + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)
#              - \langle \hat{B} \rangle\left(\theta - \frac{\pi}{2}\right)
#            \right].
#
# In our example, the parametrized unitary :math:`U(\theta)` is split into two gates,
# :math:`U = U_2 U_1`,
# where :math:`U_1=R_X` and :math:`U_1=R_Y`, and each takes an independent
# parameter :math:`\theta_i`.
#
# What happens when we apply a
# noisy channel :math:`\Lambda` after the gates? In this case,
# the expectation value is now taken with
# respect to the noisy circuit:
#
# .. math::
#
#    \langle \hat{B} \rangle (\theta) =
#           \mathrm{Tr}\left(\hat{B}\Lambda\left[
#                          U(\theta)\rho U^\dagger(\theta)
#                      \right]\right).
#
# Thus, we can treat it as the expectation value of the same
# observable, but with respect to a different state
# :math:`\rho' = \Lambda\left[U(\theta)\rho U^\dagger(\theta)\right]`.
#
# Alternatively, using the Heisenberg picture, we can transfer the channel
# :math:`\Lambda` acting on the state :math:`U(\theta)\rho U^\dagger(\theta)`
# into the *adjoint channel* :math:`\Lambda^\dagger` acting on the
# observable :math:`\hat{B}`, transforming it to a new observable
# :math:`\hat{B} = \Lambda^\dagger[\hat{B}]=\hat{B}'`.
#
# With the channel present, the expectation value can be interpreted
# as if we had the same variational state, but measured a different
# observable:
#
# .. math::
#
#    \langle \hat{B} \rangle (\theta) =
#           \mathrm{Tr}(\hat{B}'U(\theta)\rho U^\dagger(\theta)) =
#           \langle \hat{B}' \rangle (\theta).
#
# This has immediate consequences for the parameter-shift rule. With
# the channel present, we have simply
#
# .. math::
#
#    \nabla_\theta\langle \hat{B} \rangle(\theta)
#      =  \frac{1}{2}
#            \left[
#                \langle \hat{B}' \rangle\left(\theta + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)
#              - \langle \hat{B}' \rangle\left(\theta - \frac{\pi}{2}\right)
#            \right].
#
# In other words, the parameter-shift rule continues to hold for all
# gates, even when we have additional noise!
#
# .. note:: In the above derivation, we implicitly assumed that the channel
#           does not depend on the variational circuit's parameters. If the
#           channel depended on the particular state, or if it depended
#           on the parameters :math:`\theta`, we would need to be more careful.
#
#
# Let's confirm the above derivation with an example.

angles = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 50)
theta2 = np.pi / 4


def param_shift(theta1):
    return 0.5 * (
        noisy_cost([theta1 + np.pi / 2, theta2]) - noisy_cost([theta1 - np.pi / 2, theta2])
    )


noisy_expvals = [noisy_cost([theta1, theta2]) for theta1 in angles]
noisy_param_shift = [param_shift(theta1) for theta1 in angles]

plt.plot(angles, noisy_expvals, label="Expectation value")  # looks like 0.4 * cos(phi)
plt.plot(angles, noisy_param_shift, label="Parameter-shift value")  # looks like -0.4 * sin(phi)
plt.ylabel(r"Expectation value $\langle \hat{Z} \rangle$")
plt.xlabel(r"Angle $\theta_1$")
plt.legend()
plt.show()


##############################################################################
# By inspecting the two curves, we can see that the parameter-shift rule
# gives the correct gradient of the expectation value, even with the presence
# of the noisy channel!
#
# In this example, the influence of the channel is to
# attenuate the maximal amplitude that the qubit state can achieve
# (:math:`\approx 0.4`). But even though the qubit's amplitude is attenuated,
# the gradient computed by the parameter-shift rule still "points in the
# right direction".
#
# This backs up the observation we made earlier that
# the result of the optimization gave the correct values for the angle
# parameters, but the value of the final cost function was lower than
# the noise-free case.
#

##############################################################################
# Interpreting noisy circuit optimizations
# ----------------------------------------
#
# Despite the observations that we can compute gradients for
# noisy channels, and that optimization may lead to the same parameter
# values for both noise-free and noisy circuits, we must still remain
# cautious in how we interpret the results.
#
# We can evaluate the correct gradient for the expectation value
#
# .. math::
#
#    \langle \hat{B} \rangle =
#           \mathrm{Tr}\left(\hat{B}\Lambda\left[
#                          U(\theta)\rho U^\dagger(\theta)
#                      \right]\right),
#
# but, because the noisy channel is present, *this expectation value may not
# reflect the actual expectation value we wanted to compute*. This is
# important to keep in mind for certain algorithms that have a physical
# interpretation for the variational circuit.
#
# For example, in the
# :doc:`variational quantum eigensolver </demos/tutorial_vqe>`, we
# want to find the ground-state energy of a physical system.
# If there is an appreciable amount of noise present,
# the state we are optimizing will necessarily become mixed, and
# we should be careful interpreting the optimum value as the exact
# ground-state energy.

    "## Introduction to FALQON\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we'll be implement the FALQON algorithm, standing for *Feedback-based ALgorithm for Quantum OptimizatioN*, introduced by [Magann, Rudinger, Grace & Sarovar (2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08619.pdf). It is similar in spirit to the [QAOA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4028.pdf), but scales with resources differently, using iterative feedback steps rather than a global optimization over parameters. We will show how to implement FALQON in PennyLane and test its performance on the **MaxClique** problem in graph theory!\n",

    "To solve combinatorial optimization problems using a quantum computer, a typical strategy is to encode the solution to the problem as the ground state of *cost Hamiltonian* $H_C$, and choose some strategy to drive the system from a known initial state into this ground state. FALQON falls under this broad scheme. The driving strategy is implemented with a *driving Hamiltonian* $H_D$ with a single control parameter $\\beta(t)$, so the system evolves according to\n",

    "(Note that we bring the $i$ into the expectation to give a Hermitian operator.)\n",
    "Using techniques from [control theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.3997.pdf), it is possible to show this will eventually drive the system into the ground state. But there are two issues: (a) first, we need to somehow *evaluate* the expectation $A(t) := i\\langle [H_D, H_C] \\rangle_t$ to implement the driving strategy, and (b) we must do so continuously in time! This seems rather impractical. In order to solve the first problem, we can perform a [Trotter-Suzuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_product_formula) decomposition of the time evolution operator $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = U(t)|\\psi_0\\rangle$:\n",

    "\\beta_{k+1} = -A_k = -A(2k\\Delta t).\n",

    "This leads immediately to the FALQON algorithm. On step $k$, we perform the following three substeps:\n",

    "1. Prepare the state $|\\psi_k\\rangle = U_D(\\beta_k) U_C \\cdots U_D(\\beta_1) U_C|\\psi_0\\rangle$,\n",

    "3. Set $\\beta_{k+1} = -A_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provided $\\Delta t$ is small enough to ensure negligible error in our Trotter-Suzuki decomposition, after enough steps we will approach the ground state. How small $\\Delta t$ needs to be, and how large $\\ell$, are fiddly and problem-dependent questions we won't get into now. Is this a good algorithm? One simple measure is the *sampling complexity* $N_S$, the number of times we need to run a circuit (ignoring the resources required by the circuit itself). This will obviously depend on\n",

    "- the number of samples $s$ required to perform a single measurement of $i[H_C, H_D]$;\n",

    "Multiplying these gives a rough estimate for the sampling complexity $N_s = \\mathcal{O}(sm\\ell)$. We can contrast this with QAOA, which optimizes $\\langle H_C\\rangle$ over $2\\ell$ parameters (since it modulated the cost Hamiltonian as well). If it uses gradient descent, then each paramter will require separate circuit runs, leading to sampling complexity $N_S = \\mathcal{O}(qm\\ell)$, where $q$ is the number of runs needed for the classical optimization protocol. This suggests that FALQON is favorable when $s \\leq q$, i.e. it takes fewer cimeasure $i[H_C, H_D]$ than it is \n",

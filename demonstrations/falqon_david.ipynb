    "## Introduction to FALQON\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we'll be implement the FALQON algorithm, standing for *Feedback-based ALgorithm for Quantum OptimizatioN*, introduced by [Magann, Rudinger, Grace & Sarovar (2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08619.pdf). It is similar in spirit to the [QAOA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4028.pdf), but scales with resources differently, using iterative feedback steps rather than a global optimization over parameters. We will show how to implement FALQON in PennyLane and test its performance on the **MaxClique** problem in graph theory!\n",

    "To solve combinatorial optimization problems using a quantum computer, a typical strategy is to encode the solution to the problem as the ground state of *cost Hamiltonian* $H_C$, and choose some strategy to drive the system from a known initial state into this ground state. FALQON falls under this broad scheme. The driving strategy is implemented with a *driving Hamiltonian* $H_D$ with a single control parameter $\\beta(t)$, so the system evolves according to\n",

    "setting $\\hbar = 1$. We would ultimately like to minimize the expectation value of $\\langle H_C\\rangle$, so a reasonable driving strategy is simply to decrease this expectation with time:\n",

    "(Note that we bring the $i$ into the expectation to give a Hermitian operator.)\n",
    "Using techniques from [control theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.3997.pdf), it is possible to show this will eventually drive the system into the ground state. But there are two issues: (a) first, we need to somehow *evaluate* the expectation $A(t) := i\\langle [H_D, H_C] \\rangle_t$ to implement the driving strategy, and (b) we must do so continuously in time! This seems rather impractical. In order to solve the first problem, we can perform a [Trotter-Suzuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_product_formula) decomposition of the time evolution operator $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = U(t)|\\psi_0\\rangle$:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Delta t = t/2\\ell$ and $\\beta_k = \\beta(2k\\Delta t)$. Our discrete-time driving strategy is to use the value of $A(t)$ at the previous time-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\beta_{k+1} = -A_k = -A(2k\\Delta t).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads immediately to the FALQON algorithm. On step $k$, we perform the following three substeps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare the state $|\\psi_k\\rangle = U_D(\\beta_k) U_C \\cdots U_D(\\beta_1) U_C|\\psi_0\\rangle$,\n",
    "2. Measure the expectation value $A_k = \\langle i[H_C, H_D]\\rangle_k$.\n",
    "3. Set $\\beta_{k+1} = -A_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provided $\\Delta t$ is small enough to ensure negligible error in our Trotter-Suzuki decomposition, after enough steps we will approach the ground state. How small $\\Delta t$ needs to be, and how large $\\ell$, are fiddly and problem-dependent questions we won't get into now. Is this a good algorithm? One simple measure is the *sampling complexity* $N_S$, the number of times we need to run a circuit (ignoring the resources required by the circuit itself). This will obviously depend on\n",
    "\n",
    "- the number of samples $s$ required to perform a single measurement of $i[H_C, H_D]$;\n",
    "- the number of measurements $m$ we want to take in order to approximate the expectation $\\langle i[H_C, H_D]\\rangle$;  and\n",
    "- the total number of steps $\\ell$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying these gives a rough estimate for the sampling complexity $N_s = \\mathcal{O}(sm\\ell)$. We can contrast this with QAOA, which optimizes $\\langle H_C\\rangle$ over $2\\ell$ parameters (since it modulated the cost Hamiltonian as well). If it uses gradient descent, then each paramter will require separate circuit runs, leading to sampling complexity $N_S = \\mathcal{O}(qm\\ell)$, where $q$ is the number of runs needed for the classical optimization protocol. This suggests that FALQON is favorable when $s \\leq q$, i.e. it takes fewer circuit calls to measure $i[H_C, H_D]$ than it does to classically optimize a single parameter."

    "Before launching into a concrete problem, let's describe how to set up the general FALQON algorithm in PennyLane. The code will be illustrative and not executable, but will prepare us for the next section. FALQON shares many structural characteristics with [QAOA](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qaoa_intro.html), and in fact, we can use it to perform the subroutines for FALQON! We recommend looking at that tutorial for further background information. Let's start by defining the cost and driving Hamiltonians using PennyLane's `Hamiltonian` operation. We also will typically need to put in the commutator by hand:"

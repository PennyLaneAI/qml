Getting started with Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs
=======================================


This tutorial provides an introduction to running hybrid quantum-classical algorithms using
PennyLane on `Amazon Braket <https://aws.amazon.com/braket/>`__. With Amazon Braket, you gain access to both real quantum devices and
scalable classical compute, enabling you to push the boundaries of your algorithm.

In this tutorial, we'll walk through how to create your first hybrid quantum-classical algorithms on AWS.
With a single-line-of-code, we'll see how to scale from PennyLane simulators on your laptop to running full-scale experiments on AWS that leverage both powerful classical compute and quantum devices.
You'll gain understanding of the hybrid jobs queue, including QPU priority queuing, and learn how to scale classical resources for resource-intensive tasks. 
We hope these tools will empower you to start experimenting today with hybrid quantum algorithms!

Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs
-------------------------

Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs offers a way for you to run hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that
require both classical resources and quantum processing units (QPUs). Hybrid Jobs is designed to
spin up the requested classical compute, run your algorithm, and release the instances after
completion so you only pay for what you use. This workflow is ideal for long-running iterative
algorithms involving both classical and quantum resources. Simply package up your code into a single
function, create a hybrid job with a single line of code, and Braket will schedule it to run as soon
as possible without interruption.

Hybrid jobs have a separate queue from quantum tasks, so once your algorithm starts running, it will
not be interrupted by variations in the quantum task queue. This helps your long-running algorithms
run efficiently and predictably. Any quantum tasks created from a running hybrid job will be run
before any other quantum tasks in the queue. This is particularly beneficial for iterative hybrid
algorithms where subsequent tasks depend on the outcomes of prior quantum tasks. Examples of such
algorithms include the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), Variational Quantum
Eigensolver (VQE), or Quantum Machine Learning (QML). You can also monitor your algorithm's progress in near-real
time, enabling you to keep track of costs, budget, or custom metrics such as training loss or
expectation values.

Importantly, on specific QPUs, running your algorithm in Hybrid Jobs benefits from `parametric compilation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-jobs-parametric-compilation.html>`__. 
This reduces the overhead associated with the computationally expensive compilation step by compiling a circuit only once and not for every iteration in your hybrid algorithm. 
This dramatically reduces the total runtime for many variational algorithms.
For long-running hybrid jobs, Braket automatically uses the updated calibration data from the hardware provider when compiling your circuit to ensure the highest quality results.

Getting started with PennyLane
------------------------------

Let’s setup an algorithm that makes use of both classical and quantum resources. We adapt the :doc:`PennyLane qubit rotation tutorial<tutorial_qubit_rotation>`.

######################################################################
# Running as a hybrid job
# -----------------------
#
# To run our algorithm for a long time, we can run it asynchronously with Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs,
# which fully manages the classical infrastructure so you can focus on the algorithm. For example, you
# can train a larger circuit, or increase the number of iterations. Note that each hybrid job has
# at least a one minute startup time since it creates a containerized environment on Amazon EC2. So
# for very short workloads, such as a single circuit or a batch of circuits, it may suffice for you to
# use quantum tasks.
#
# We now show how you can go from running your local Python function to running it as a hybrid job.
# Note that only Python 3.10 is supported by default. For custom environments, you can opt to hybrid
# job scripts, or a custom container from Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) (see `containers
# documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-jobs-byoc.html>`__).
#
# The first step to creating a hybrid job is to annotate which function you want to run with the
# ``@hybrid_job`` decorator. Then you create the job by invoking the function as you would for normal
# Python functions. However, the decorated function returns the hybrid job handle rather than the
# result of the function. To retrieve the results after it has been completed, use ``job.result()``.
#
# The required device argument in the ``@hybrid_job`` decorator specifies the QPU that the hybrid job
# will have priority access to.
# The device string you give is accessible in the hybrid job instance as the environment variable ``AMZN_BRAKET_DEVICE_ARN``.
#
# When using on-demand simulators or `embedded simulators <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/pennylane-embedded-simulators.html>`__,
# you may provide the device argument as string of the form: ``"local:<provider>/<simulator_name>"`` or simply ``None``.
# For example, you may set ``"local:pennylane/lightning.qubit"`` for the `PennyLane lightning simulator <https://pennylane.ai/performance>`__.
#
# In the following code, we annotate the ``qubit_rotation`` function from above.
#

from braket.jobs import hybrid_job


@hybrid_job(device="local:pennylane/lightning.qubit")
def qubit_rotation_hybrid_job(num_steps=1, stepsize=0.5):
    return qubit_rotation(num_steps=num_steps, stepsize=stepsize)


######################################################################
# Now we create a hybrid job by calling the function as usual. This returns an ``AwsQuantumJob`` object
# that contains the device ARN, region, and job name.
#

job = qubit_rotation_hybrid_job(num_steps=10, stepsize=0.5)
print(job)

##############################################################################
# .. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out
#
#  .. code-block:: none
#
#       AwsQuantumJob('arn':'arn:aws:braket:<aws-region>:<account_id>:job/qubit-rotation-hybrid-job-1695044583')

######################################################################
# The hybrid job automatically captures the function arguments as hyperparameters.
# In this case, we set ``num_steps = 10`` and ``stepsize = 0.5`` as the hyperparameters.
#
# We can check the status with:
#

######################################################################
# Once the hybrid job starts, it will change the status to ``RUNNING``. We can also check the hybrid
# job status in the Braket console.
#
# After the hybrid job completes, we can get the results with ``job.result()``. For this example, it
# should take approximately 2 minutes.

# Running on a QPU with priority
# ----------------
#
# The next step is to see how well the qubit rotation works on a real QPU. We
# create a hybrid job with the Rigetti device as the priority QPU. We also increase the number of
# steps to 10.
#
# Using hybrid jobs for iterative algorithms is very beneficial because you retain priority access to the
# target QPU. So once your quantum tasks are created in the hybrid job, they run ahead of other tasks
# waiting in the *quantum task queue*. This means your
# algorithm will not be interrupted by other quantum tasks, so it will run more efficiently and
# predictably. Quantum tasks submitted as part of a hybrid job have priority, and are aggregated in the *priority task queue*.
#
# Hybrid jobs have their own *hybrid jobs queue* so that only a single
# hybrid job can run on a QPU at a time.
# Each QPU has its own hybrid jobs queue. Note that this is a different queue from the quantum tasks. For a single quantum circuit, or a batch of circuits, it’s
# recommended to create quantum tasks instead of hybrid jobs.
# For more information on quantum tasks and hybrid jobs queue see the `Amazon Braket documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-task-when.html>`__.
#
# To get QPU priority, you must ensure that the device ARN used within the function matches that
# specified in the decorator. For convenience, you can use the helper function ``get_device_arn()`` to
# automatically capture the device ARN declared in ``@hybrid_job``.
#
# .. note::
#   Only hybrid jobs running on AWS receive priority. Hybrid jobs running `locally <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-jobs-local-mode.html>`__,
#   or with a mismatched device ARN do not get priority task queueing.
#
# In the previous example, we declared the local simulator outside the decorated function scope.
# However, for AWS devices such as QPUs or on-demand simulators, the device must be declared within the function scope.
#
# .. note::
#   AWS devices must be declared within the body of the decorated function.

# Conclusion
# ------------
#
# In this tutorial, we showed how to migrate from local Python functions to running algorithms on simulators and QPUs on Amazon Braket.
# We adapted the simple example of rotating a qubit using gradient descent, running this on both a local simulator and a real QPU.
# Using Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs allowed us to run algorithms asynchronously, scale classical compute using AWS, and obtain priority access to the selected QPU for the duration of our algorithm.

The term "chemical reaction" is another name for the transformation of molecules -- the breaking and 
forming of bonds. They are characterized by an energy barrier that determines
the likelihood that a reaction takes place. The energy landscapes formed by these barriers are the
key to understanding how chemical reactions occur, at the deepest possible level.

    An example chemical reaction.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use PennyLane to simulate chemical reactions by
constructing potential energy surfaces for molecular transformations. In the process, you will
learn how quantum computers can be used to calculate equilibrium bond lengths, activation energy
barriers, and reaction rates. As illustrative
examples, we use tools implemented in PennyLane to study diatomic bond dissociation and reactions
involving the exchange of hydrogen atoms.


Potential Energy Surfaces 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

`Potential energy surfaces (PES) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy_surface>`_
describe the energy of molecules for different positions of
its atoms. The concept originates from the fact that the electrons are much lighter than protons
and neutrons, so they will adjust instantaneously to the new positions of the nuclei. This leads
to a separation of the nuclear and electronic parts of the Schrödinger equation, meaning we only need
to solve the electronic equation:

.. math:: H(R)|\Psi \rangle =  E|\Psi\rangle.

From this perspective arises the concept of the electronic energy of a molecule, :math:`E(R)`,
as a function of nuclear coordinates :math:`R`. The energy :math:`E(R)` is the expectation value
of the molecular Hamiltonian, :math:`E(R)=\langle \Psi_0|H(R)|\Psi_0\rangle`, taken
with respect to the ground state :math:`|\Psi_0(R)\rangle`. The potential energy surface is
precisely this function :math:`E(R)`, which connects energies to different geometries of the
molecule. It gives us a visual tool to understand chemical reactions by associating
stable molecules (reactants and products) with local minima, transition states with peaks,
and by identifying the possible routes for a chemical reaction to occur.

To build the potential energy surface, we compute the energy for fixed positions of the nuclei,
and subsequently adjust the positions of the nuclei in incremental steps, computing the energies at each new configuration.
The obtained set of energies corresponds to a grid of nuclear positions and the plot of
:math:`E(R)` gives rise to the potential energy surface.

Bond dissociation in a Hydrogen molecule 
----------------------------------------

We now construct a potential energy surface and use it to compute equilibrium bond lengths and
the bond dissociation energy. We begin with the simplest of molecules: :math:`H_2`.
The formation or breaking of the :math:`H-H` bond is also the most
elementary of all reactions:

.. math:: H_2 \rightarrow H + H.

Using a minimal `basis set <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STO-nG_basis_sets>`_,
this molecular system can be described by two electrons in four
spin-orbitals. When mapped to a qubit representation, we need a total of four qubits.
The *Hartree-Fock (HF) state* is represented as :math:`|1100\rangle`, where the two
lowest-energy orbitals are occupied, and the remaining two are unoccupied.

We design a quantum circuit consisting of :class:`~.pennylane.SingleExcitation` and
:class:`~.pennylane.DoubleExcitation` gates applied to the Hartree-Fock state. This circuit
will be optimized to prepare ground states for different configurations of the molecule.

# To construct the potential energy surface, we vary the location of the nuclei and calculate the

# surface is then a one-dimensional function depending only on the bond length, i.e., the separation
# between the atoms. For each value of the bond length, we construct the corresponding
# Hamiltonian, then optimize the circuit using gradient descent to obtain the ground-state energy.
# We vary the bond length in the range
# :math:`0.5` to :math:`5.0` `Bohrs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_radius>`_ in steps of

# Hydrogen Exchange Reaction
# -----------------------------
#
# After studying a simple diatomic bond dissociation, we move to a slightly more complicated
# case: a hydrogen exchange reaction.
#
# .. math:: H_2 + H \rightarrow H + H_2.
#
# This reaction has a barrier, the `transition state
# <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_state>`_, that must be crossed
# for the exchange of an atom to be complete. In this case, the transition state
# corresponds to a specific linear arrangement of the atoms where one :math:`H-H` bond is
# partially broken and the other :math:`H-H` bond is partially formed.
# The molecular movie ⚛️🎥 below is an illustration of the reaction trajectory. It depicts how the distance
# between the hydrogen atoms changes as one bond is broken and another one is formed.
# The path along which the reaction proceeds is known as the `reaction coordinate
# <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_coordinate>`_.

# Activation energy barriers and reaction rates
# ---------------------------------------------
#
# The potential energy surfaces we computed so far can be leveraged for other important tasks,
# such as computing activation energy barriers and reaction rates. The activation energy barrier (
# :math:`E_{a}`) is defined as the difference between the energy of the reactants and the energy
# of the transition state.
#
# .. math:: E_{a} = E_{TS} - E_{R}.
#
# This can be computed from the potential energy surface:

# Energy of the reactants and products - two minima on the PES
e_eq1 = min(energies)
e_eq2 = min([x for x in energies if x != e_eq1])

idx1 = energies.index(e_eq1)
idx2 = energies.index(e_eq2)

# Transition state is the local maximum between reactant and products
idx_min = min(idx1, idx2)
idx_max = max(idx1, idx2)

# Transition state energy
energy_ts = max(energies[idx_min:idx_max])

# Activation energy
activation_energy = energy_ts - e_eq1

print(f"The activation energy is {activation_energy:.6f} Hartrees")

##############################################################################
# The reaction rate constant (:math:`k`) has an exponential dependence on the activation energy
# barrier, as shown in the `Arrhenius equation
# <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhenius_equation>`_ (Arrr! 🏴‍☠️):
#
# .. math:: k = Ae^{-{E_{a}}/k_BT},
#
# where :math:`k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, :math:`T` is the temperature, and :math:`A` is a
# pre-exponential factor that can be determined empirically for each reaction. Crucially, the rate at which
# a chemical reaction occurs depends exponentially on the activation energy computed from the PES --- this is a good reminder of the importance
# of performing highly-accurate calculations in quantum chemistry!
#
# For example, let's calculate the ratio of reaction rates when the temperature is doubled. We have
#
# .. math:: \frac{k_2}{k_1}=\frac{Ae^{-{E_{a}}/k_B(2T)}}{Ae^{-{E_{a}}/k_BT}}=e^{E_a/2k_B T}.
#
# We choose :math:`T=300` Kelvin, which is essentially room temperature. This makes doubling the
# temperature roughly equivalent to the temperature inside a pizza oven.  We have

# convert to joules
activation_energy *= 4.36e-18
# Boltzmann constant in Joules/Kelvin
k_B = 1.38e-23
# Temperature
T = 300

ratio = np.exp(activation_energy / (2 * k_B * T))

print(f"Ratio of reaction rates is {ratio:.0f}")

##############################################################################
# Doubling the temperature can increase the rate by a factor of almost two million! For a similar
# reason, changing the activation energy can lead to drastic changes in the reaction rates,
# which means we have to be careful to compute it very accurately.
#
# Conclusion
# ----------
# We can learn how atoms combine to form different molecules by performing experiments; this is
# the approach many of us learn as children by playing with chemistry sets. However, a deeper
# quantitative understanding of chemical reactions can be achieved by performing theoretical
# simulations of the mechanisms for forming and breaking bonds. This tutorial described how
# simple chemical reactions can be simulated using quantum algorithms that reconstruct
# potential energy surfaces, allowing us to identify reactants and products as minima of the
# energy, and transition states as local maxima. These results can then be used to calculate
# activation energies and reaction rates. The goal (and challenge!) for quantum computing is to
# improve both hardware and algorithms to reach the regime where providing accurate simulations
# becomes intractable for existing methods. If successful, this quest will
# allow us to understand the properties of quantum systems in ways that have so far been out of
# reach.

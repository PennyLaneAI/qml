#
# **Measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC)**, also known as one-way quantum computing, is an
# inventive approach to quantum computing that makes use of *off-line* entanglement as a resource
# for computation. A one-way quantum computer starts out with an entangled state, a so-called
# *cluster state*, and applies particular single-qubit measurements that correspond to the desired quantum circuit. In this context,
# off-line means that the entanglement is created independently from the rest of the
# computation, like how a blank sheet of paper is made separately from the text of a book. Coming
# from the gate-based model, this method might seem unintuitive to you at first, but the approaches
# can be proven to be equally powerful. In MBQC, the measurements *are* the computation and the
# entanglement of the cluster state is used as a resource.
#
# The structure of this demo will be as follows. First, we introduce the concept of a cluster
# state, the substrate for measurement-based quantum computation. Then, we will move on to explain
# how to implement arbitrary quantum circuits, thus proving that MBQC is universal. Lastly, we will
# briefly touch upon how quantum error correction (QEC) is done in this scheme.
#
# Throughout this tutorial, we will explain the underlying concepts with the help of some code
# snippets using `PennyLane <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_. In the section about QEC,
# we will also use Xanadu's quantum error correction simulation software
# `FlamingPy <https://flamingpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ developed by our architecture team
# [#XanaduPassiveArchitecture]_.

#
# Cluster states and graph states
# ----------------
#
# *Cluster states* are the universal substrate for measurement-based quantum computation
# [#OneWay2001]_. They are a special instance of *graph states* [#EntanglementGraphStates]_, a
# class of entangled multi-qubit states that can be represented by an undirected graph
# :math:`G = (V,E)` whose vertices :math:`V` are associated with qubits and the edges :math:`E` with entanglement
# between them. The associated quantum state reads as follows
#
# .. math::    |\Phi\rangle=\Pi_{(i,j)\in E}CZ_{ij}|+⟩^{\otimes n}.
#
# where :math:`n` is the number of qubits, :math:`CZ_{ij}` is the controlled-:math:`Z`` gate between
# qubits :math:`i` and :math:`j`, and :math:`|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\big(|0\rangle + |1\rangle\big)`
# is the :math:`+1`` eigenstate of the Pauli-:math:`X` operator. The distinction between graph
# states and a cluster states is rather technical and details can be found in Ref.
# [#PersistentEntanglement]_. For now, suffice to say that cluster states are a subset of graph
# states with some additional conditions.
#
# We can also describe the creation of a cluster state in the gate-based model. Let us first
# define a graph we want to look at, and then construct a circuit in PennyLane to create the
# corresponding graph state.
#

import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

a, b = 1, 5  # dimensions of the graph (lattice)
G = nx.grid_graph(dim=[a, b])  # there are a * b qubits

plt.figure(figsize=(5, 1))
nx.draw(G, pos={node: node for node in G}, node_size=500, node_color="black")

##############################################################################
#
# This is a fairly simple cluster state, but we will later see how even
# this simple graph is useful for logical operations. Now that we have defined a graph, we can go ahead
# and define a circuit to prepare the cluster state.
#

import pennylane as qml

qubits = [str(node) for node in G.nodes]
dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=qubits)


@qml.qnode(dev, interface="autograd")
def cluster_state():
    for node in qubits:
        qml.Hadamard(wires=[node])

    for edge in G.edges:
        i, j = edge
        qml.CZ(wires=[str(i), str(j)])

    return qml.state()


print(qml.draw(cluster_state)())

##############################################################################
#
# Observe that the structure of the circuit is fairly simple. It only requires Hadamard
# gates on each qubit and then a controlled-:math:`Z` gate between connected qubits. This part of
# the computation is not actually computing anything. In fact, aside from the width and depth of
# the desired quantum circuit, the cluster state generation is essentially independent of the
# calculation. If you have a reliable way of applying these two operations (Hadamard and
# controlled-:math:`Z`), you are ready for the next step: worrying about conditional single-qubit
# measurements.
#

##############################################################################
# Information propagation and teleportation
# ------------------------------------------
#
# Measurement-based quantum computation heavily relies on the idea of information propagation. In
# particular, we make use of a protocol called *quantum teleportation*, one of the driving concepts behind MBQC. Despite its Sci-Fi name, quantum
# teleportation is very real and has been experimentally demonstrated multiple times in the last few decades
# [#Hermans2022]_, [#Furusawa1998]_, [#Riebe2004]_, [#Nielsen1998]_. Moreover, it has related applications
# in safe communication protocols that are impossible with classical communication so it's certainly
# worth learning about. In this protocol, we transport *information*, not matter, between systems. Admittedly, it has a
# somewhat misleading name because it is not instantaneous: it requires communication of
# additional classical information, which is still limited by the speed of light.
#
# One-qubit Teleportation
# `````````````````````
# Let's take a deeper look at the principles behind quantum teleportation using a simple example of one-qubit
# teleportation. We start with one qubit in the state :math:`|\psi\rangle` that we want to transfer
# to the second qubit initially in the state :math:`|0\rangle`. The figure below represents the
# protocol. The green box represents the creation of a cluster state, while
# the red box represents the measurement of a qubit with the appropriate correction applied to
# the second qubit based on the measurement outcome.

# expected. To do so, we'll generate a random normalized state :math:`|\psi\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle`

#
# As we can see, :math:`|\psi\rangle`, originally the state of the first qubit, has been transported to the second qubit!
#
# This protocol is one of the main ingredients of one-way quantum computing. Essentially, we
# propagate the information in one end of our cluster state to the other end through
# successive teleportations. In addition, we can "write" our circuit onto the cluster state by
# choosing the measurements adaptively. In the next section, we will see how we can actually do this.
#

##############################################################################
# Universality of MBQC
# ----------------------
# How do we know if this measurement-based scheme is just as powerful as its gate-based counterpart? We
# have to prove it! In particular, we want to show that a measurement-based quantum computer is a
# `quantum Turing machine (QTM) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Turing_machine>`_. To do this, we
# need to show 4 things [#OneWay2001]_:
#
# 1. How **information propagates** through the cluster state.
#
# 2. How arbitrary **single-qubit rotations** can be implemented.
#
# 3. How a **two-qubit gate** can be implemented in this scheme.
#
# 4. How to implement **arbitrary quantum circuits**.
#
# In the previous section, we have already seen how the quantum information propagates from one
# side of the cluster to the other. In this
# section, we will tackle the remaining parts concerning logical operations. Throughout, we will
# assume the ability to measure in arbitrary bases.
#

##############################################################################
#
# .. _single-qubit-rotations:
#
# Single-qubit rotations
# ```````````````````````
# Arbitrary single-qubit rotations are essential operations for a universal quantum computer. In
# MBQC, we can implement these rotations by using the entanglement of the cluster state. Any
# single-qubit gate can be represented as a composition of three rotations along two different axes,
# for example :math:`U(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) = R_x(\gamma)R_z(\beta)R_x(\alpha)` where
# :math:`R_x` and :math:`R_z` represent rotations around the :math:`X` and :math:`Z` axis,
# respectively.
#
# We will see that in our measurement-based scheme, this operation can be implemented using a linear
# chain of 5 qubits prepared in a cluster state, as shown in the figure below [#MBQCRealization]_. The first qubit
# :math:`t_\mathrm{in}` is prepared in some input state :math:`|\psi_\mathrm{in}\rangle`,
# and we are interested in the final state of the output qubit :math:`t_\mathrm{out}`.
#
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/mbqc/single-qubit-rotation.png
#    :align: center
#    :alt: Measurement-based single qubit rotation
#    :width: 75%
#
#    ..
#
# The input qubit :math:`t_\mathrm{in}`, together with the intermediate qubits :math:`a_1`,
# :math:`a_2`, and :math:`a_3` are then measured in the bases
#
# .. math::
#   \mathcal{B}_j(\theta_j) \equiv \left\{\frac{|0\rangle + e^{i\theta_j}|1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}},
#   \frac{|0\rangle - e^{i\theta_j}|1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\right\},
#
# where the angles :math:`\theta_j` depend on prior measurement outcomes and
# are given by
#
# .. math:: \theta_{\mathrm{in}} = 0, \qquad \theta_{1} = (-1)^{m_{\mathrm{in}} + 1} \alpha, \qquad
#   \theta_{2} = (-1)^{m_1} \beta, \quad \text{and} \quad \theta_{3} = (-1)^{m_{\mathrm{in}} + m_2} \gamma
#
# with :math:`m_{\mathrm{in}}, m_1, m_2 \in \{0, 1\}` being the measurement outcomes on nodes
# :math:`t_\mathrm{in}`, :math:`a_1` and :math:`a_2`, respectively. Note that the
# measurement basis is adaptive; the measurement on :math:`a_3`, for example, depends on the outcome
# of earlier measurements in the chain. After these operations, the state of qubit
# :math:`t_\mathrm{out}` is given by
#
# .. math:: |\psi_{\mathrm{out}}\rangle = \tilde{U}(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)|\psi_{\mathrm{in}}\rangle
#    = X^{m_1 + m_3}Z^{m_{\mathrm{in}} + m_2}U(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)
#    |\psi_{\mathrm{in}}\rangle.
#
# with :math:`m_3` being the measurement outcome on node :math:`a_3`. Now note that this unitary 
# :math:`\tilde{U}` is related to our desired unitary :math:`U` up to
# the first two Pauli terms. Luckily, we can correct for these additional Pauli gates by
# choosing the measurement basis of qubit :math:`t_\mathrm{out}` appropriately or correcting for them classically after
# the quantum computation.
#
# To demonstrate that this actually works, we will use PennyLane. For simplicity, we will just
# show the ability will to perform single-axis rotations :math:`R_z(\theta)` and
# :math:`R_x(\theta)` for arbitrary :math:`\theta \in [0, 2 \pi)`. Note that these two operations
# plus the CNOT also constitute a universal gate set.
#
# To start off, we define the :math:`R_z(\theta)` gate using two qubits with the gate-based approach
# so we can later compare our MBQC approach to it.

# Arbitrary quantum circuits
# ```````````````````````````
# Once we have established the ability to implement arbitrary single-qubit rotations and a two-qubit
# gate, the final step is to show that we can implement arbitrary quantum circuits. To do so,
# we simply have to note that we have a *universal gate set* [#DiVincenzo]_. The complete computation
# can be performed as shown in the figure below. The qubits are teleported along the arrows in the
# cluster and single-qubit gates are applied through a selection of measurement bases along these arrays.
# Two-qubit gates are implemented along vertical arrows, and the rest of the qubits are measured in the
# :math:`Z`-basis, effectively taking them out of the cluster without affecting the neighboring nodes.

#    tilted arrows :math:`\nwarrow` or :math:`\nearrow` refer to
#    measurements in the :math:`xy`-plane. [#OneWay2001]_
#
# However, you might wonder: Is it even feasible to construct the large cluster states that
# one-way quantum computation requires? The number of qubits needed to construct a circuit can grow
# to be very large, as it not only depends on the number of logical qubits, but also on the depth
# of the circuit. At this point, it's good to reiterate that the entanglement of the cluster
# state is created *off-line*. 
#
# *...the entanglement is created independently from the rest of the computation, like how a blank
# sheet of paper is made separately from the text of a book.*
#
# Interestingly enough, we do not have to prepare all of the entanglement at once. Just like we can
# already start printing text upon the first few pages, we can apply measurements to one end of the
# cluster while growing it at the same time, as shown in the figure below. That is, we can start
# printing the text on the first few pages while at the same time reloading the printer's paper

#    destroying the entanglement and removing them from the cluster. At the same time, the green
#    qubits are being added to the cluster by entangling them with it. Prior measurement outcomes
#    determine the basis for future measurements [#OpticalQuantumComputing]_.
#
# This feature makes it particularly attractive for photonic quantum computers: we can use
# expendable qubits that can't stick around for the full calculation. If we can find a
# reliable way to produce qubits and stitch them together through entanglement, we can use it to
# produce our cluster state resource! Essentially, we need some kind of qubit factory and a
# stitching mechanism that puts it all together. The stitching mechanism depends on the physical
# platform; for example, it can be implemented with an Ising interaction [#OneWay2001]_ or by 
# interfering two optical modes with a beamsplitter [#XanaduPassiveArchitecture]_.

# Quantum error correction
# -------------------------
#
# To mitigate the physical errors that can (and will) happen during a quantum computation, we
# require some kind of error correction scheme. Error correction is a technique for detecting errors and
# reconstructing the logical data with as little information loss as possible. It is not exclusive 
# to quantum computing; it is also used in "classical" information processing such as computation, 
# data storage, and communication where one also has to deal `with
# noise coming from the environment <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaZ_RSt0KP8>`_. However, it is
# a stringent requirement in the quantum realm as the systems one works with are much more
# precarious and therefore prone to environmental factors, causing errors.
#
# Due to the peculiarities of quantum physics, we have to be careful when implementing error
# correction. First of all, we can not simply look inside our quantum computer and see if an error occurred; this would collapse the
# wavefunction, which carries valuable information. Secondly, we can not make copies of a quantum
# state to create redundancy because of the *no-cloning theorem*. Lastly, there are infinitely many
# more errors in quantum computing, whereas the only errors in classical computing are bit flips: a 1
# being flipped to a 0 or vice versa.
#
# A whole research field devoted to combating these challenges has formed since Peter Shor published his
# seminal paper in 1995 [#ShorQEC1995]_. The main idea in QEC is using redundancy to encode 
# information, just like classical error correction. However, to 
# overcome the quantum-specific problems, we must measure groups of qubits and observe correlations 
# between rather than measuring individual qubits.  More technically, we measure
# operators that involve multiple qubits, called *stabilizers*. Based on the outcome of these stabilizer
# measurements, we can apply a correction and recover our information. 
# Full coverage of this topic is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but a good place to start is
# `Daniel Gottesman's thesis <https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9705052>`_ or `this blog post by
# Arthur Pesah <https://arthurpesah.me/blog/2022-01-25-intro-qec-1/>`_ for a more compact
# introduction. Instead, we will give you the gist of quantum error correction in the
# MBQC framework. We will do so by using the surface code [#FowlerSurfaceCode]_ [#FowlerPolyestimate]_ [#GoogleQEC2022]_ as an example. This code makes use of stabilizers of the form :math:`\bigotimes_i X_i` or 
# :math:`\bigotimes_j Z_j`, as depicted below.

#    :width: 50%
#
#    ..
#
#    A distance :math:`d=3` surface code. Circles represent qubits and bubbles represent operators, called
#    stabilizers, used to detect errors. The stabilizers are tensor products of Pauli-:math:`X` or Pauli-:math:`Z`
#    operators and each is associated with its own ancilla qubit. The combined system encodes one
#    logical qubit and can correct any combination of :math:`\lfloor (d-1)/2 \rfloor` errors.
#    [#FowlerPolyestimate]_
#
# In the measurement-based picture, quantum error correction requires cluster states that are at

# dictates the structure of the cluster state. The cluster state that is associated with the surface code is known as the RHG lattice,
# named after its architects Raussendorf, Harrington, and Goyal. We can visualize this cluster
# state with FlamingPy.

# For the sake of intuition, you can think of the graph shown above as having two spatial dimensions (:math:`x`
# and :math:`y`) and one temporal dimension (:math:`z`). The cluster state alternates between *primal* and *dual sheets*, shown below in more detail. 
# In principle, any quantum error correction stabilizer code can be `foliated <https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02579>`_ into
# a graph state for measurement-based QEC [#FoliatedQuantumCodes]_, [#UniversalFTMBQC]_. However, the foliations are particularly nice for `CSS
# codes <https://errorcorrectionzoo.org/c/css>`_, named after Calderbank, Shor, and Steane. CSS codes have stabilizers that exclusively contain
# :math:`X`-stabilizers *or* :math:`Z`-stabilizers, and include the *surface code* and *colour code* families.
# For these CSS codes, you can roughly view the primal and dual sheets as measuring the
# :math:`Z`-stabilizers and :math:`X`-stabilizers, respectively. We encourage you to have another 
# look at the :ref:`figure <fig-surfacecode>` with the distance-3 surface code and try to link it 
# with the dual and primal sheets shown here!

#
# The computation and error correction are again performed with single-qubit measurements, as illustrated below.
# At each timestep, we measure all the qubits on one sheet of the lattice. The binary
# outcomes of these measurements determine the measurement bases for future measurements, and the
# last sheet of the lattice contains the encoded result of the computation which can be read out by yet another measurement.

# Conclusion
# -------------------------------
#
# We have learned that a one-way quantum computer capable of cluster state
# entanglement together with adaptive arbitrary single-qubit measurements allows for universal
# quantum computation. The MBQC framework is a powerful quantum computing approach, particularly
# useful in platforms that allow for many expendable flying qubits and easy physical entangling 
# gates. It circumvents the need for applying in-line entangling gates that are often the most 
# noisy operations in gate-based quantum computers with trapped-ions or superconducting circuits. 
# Instead, the required entanglement is created off-line which is often simpler to implement. 
# Furthermore, it's advantageous for photonics because the depth of the optical circuit can remain 
# constant. This means that it does not grow with the depth of the logical circuit, preventing 
# intolerable losses.
#
# In this demo, we assumed that the system is capable of performing arbitrary
# single-qubit measurements. This is not a strict requirement, as one can acquire the same
# capabilities by sprinkling *magic states* into the cluster state. A discussion of this topic is
# beyond the scope of this tutorial, but a good place to start is `this
# paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403025>`_ [#MagicStates]_.
#
# Xanadu's approach toward a universal quantum computer involves *continuous-variable* cluster states
# [#CV-MBQC]_. If you would like to learn more about the architecture, you can read our blueprint
# papers [#XanaduBlueprint]_ and [#XanaduPassiveArchitecture]_. We also highly recommend watching `this
# video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD6TH7GZ1rM&feature=emb_title>`_ outlining the main ideas!

#
# Measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) is a clever approach towards quantum computing that
# makes use of *offline* entanglement as a resource for computation. This method, also referred to as one-way
# quantum computing, seems very dissimilar from the gate-based model. However, they can be proven to
# be equivalent and so both are universal. In a one-way quantum computer, we start out with an entangled state, a so-called cluster state, and
# apply particular single-qubit measurements that correspond to the desired quantum circuit. In
# MBQC, the measurements *are* the computation and the entanglement of the cluster state is used as a
# resource.
#
# The structure of this demo will be as follows. First we introduce the concept of a cluster state, 
# the substrate for measurement-based quantum computation. Then, we will move on to explain to 
# implement arbitrary quantum circuits, thus proving that MBQC is also universal. In particular, we 
# will illustrate
# 1. How **information propagates** through the cluster state.
# 2. How **arbitrary qubit rotations** can be implemented.
# 3. How a **two-qubit gate** can be implemented in this scheme.
#
# Once these operations are explained, we will move on to fault-tolerance and sketch how this can be
# achieved through lattice surgery. Throughout this tutorial, we will explain the underlying concepts 
# with the help of some `PennyLane<https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ and 
# `FlamingPy<https://flamingpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ code snippets. The latter is a relatively
# new software package developped by Xanadu's architecture team for quantum error correction research.

# Cluster states
# =================
#
# Cluster states are the basis of measurement-based quantum computation. They are a special instance 
# of graph states, a class of entangled multi-qubit states that can be represented by an undirected 
# graph :math:`G = (V,E)` whose vertices are associated with qubits and the edges with entanglement 
# between them. The associated quantum state reads as follows
#
# .. math::    |\psi\rangle=\Pi_{(i,j)\in E(G)}CZ_{ij}|+‚ü©^{\otimes n}.
#
# The difference between a cluster state and a graph state is that the cluster state is ...

# Information propagation and Teleportation
# ======================================
# 
# Measurement-based quantum computation heavily relies on the idea of information propagation. In 
# particular, we make use of a protocol called *teleportation*. 
# Admittedly, this is a rather delusive name, but it is a powerful idea that can be used in many 
# quantum technologies like communication and, indeed, MBQC.
#
# Let us consider a simple example of teleportation. We start with a maximally entangled 2-qubit 
# state, a Bell state. To relate this to the cluster states - this is a cluster state with two nodes
# and one edge connecting them.

# The two-qubit gate: CNOT

# The last ingredient for a universal quantum computing scheme is the two-qubit gate. Here, we will
# show how to do a CNOT in the measurement-based framework.

# Fault-tolerance
# ======================
#
# To mitigate the risk of failure during a quantum computation we require quantum error correction.
# This requires a 3-dimensional cluster state [CITE]

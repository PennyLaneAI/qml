Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~S

Most of us, on their journey as quantum computing researchers, have at some stage tried to understand the algorithm for the Quantum Fourier Transform - the workhorse subroutine behind a lot of known quantum speedups. While brooding over Nielsen and Chuang, or the textbook of your choice, you might have wondered how one would ever come up with such an algorithm. 

If you were courageous enough to dig into the literature inventing the QFT, such as Kitaev's paper from 1995 that is often attributed to contain the first ideas, what you find is...group theory. And if you follow the trail of papers into the 2000's, you only find more group theory. And if you dig deeper you find occasional references to the Fast Fourier Transform, a fast implementation of the Fourier transform and arguably one of the most influential algorithms in scientific computing.

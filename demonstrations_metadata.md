# Demonstrations Metadata

This document describes the structure of the JSON files that hold the metadata for the demonstrations.

The metadata JSON file for a given demo should be stored in the same folder as the Python demo file. It should have exactly the same name, except ending with `.metadata.json` instead of `.py`.



## Example

Below is given an example of a complete metadata file for a demonstration.

| `volume` | No | `string` | The volume of the journal or the multi-volume book. |
| `number` | No | `string` | The number of the journal. | 

### Related Content Object Properties

| Name | Is Required | Value Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | Yes | `string` | The type of content that this relation refers to. So far, can only be `demonstration`, but this will be expanded in future. |
| `id` | Yes | `string` | The id of the content that this relation refers to. For demos, it's the file name of the demo without the extension - i.e., `tutorial_haar_measure`. |
| `weight` | Yes | `number` | A number between -1.0 and 1.0 indicating both how closely related these two pieces of content are, and which one it is preferable to encounter first. A value of 1.0 indicates that these two pieces of content are *very* closely related, and this one should be read first, and the linked one second. A value of -1.0 indicates again that these two pieces of content are very closely related, but that the linked one should be read first. A value of 0.0 indicates that these two pieces of content have nothing to do with each other. |

### Hardware Object Properties

| Name | Is Required | Value Type | Description |

## Validation

The best way to ensure that your metadata file is consistent with the spec outlined here is to _validate_ it. Install and run [check-jsonschema](https://check-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) against the version of the spec defined above:

```bash
pip install check-jsonschema 'jsonschema[format]'
cd metadata_schemas
check-jsonschema --schemafile demo.metadata.schema.<version>.json ../demonstrations/<your_demo_name>.metadata.json
```

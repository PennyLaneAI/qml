    Calculates how many files should be allocated per worker based on the total number of files found.

    Example:
        If you have 15 tutorials (files are globed using pathlib):
        [
          "0.py",  # File names in this case are their respective indexes in this list (illustrative purpose)
          "1.py",

          "13.py",
          "14.py"
        ]
        And you have 3 workers, then the files to be executed per worker is:
        math.ceil(15 / 3) = 5

        So in this scenario this function would return the WorkerFileCount(total_files=15, files_per_worker=5)

    Args:
        num_workers:  The total number of workers that will be spawned.
        sphinx_examples_dir: The directory where all the sphinx demonstrations reside
        glob_pattern: The pattern use to glob all demonstration files inside sphinx_examples_dir. Defaults to "*.py"

        of files to workers `files_per_worker`.

    Given the path to a sphinx python file, this function finds the usage of a given sphinx role in the file and returns
    the targets for those roles.

    To read more on sphinx roles, refer to: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/roles.html

    The general syntax for a sphinx role consists of  ":role:`target`"

    This function uses regex to parse out the given role from the sphinx file. It returns a list that are targets
    in a given sphinx file for a given sphinx role.

    It behaves as the following:

    :role: `target`
               ^
            The value of this target is returned

    :role: `title <target>`
                    ^
                The value of this target is returned

    Args:

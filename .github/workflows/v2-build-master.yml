name: V2 Build Master for Production Environment

# WIP #
# The following workflow is responsible for the following:
# 1. Identifying changed demos in the master branch when a PR is merged.
# 2. Building the demos that have changed.
# 3. Save the build context in an artifact for later use in the V2 Deploy Production workflow.
# 4. If successful, trigger the V2 Deploy Production workflow.
# Notes: We want to ensure that the builds are queued and not cancelled if a new PR is merged while the build is in progress.

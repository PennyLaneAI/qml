# Dependency Specification

This directory houses the files that specify and constrain the dependencies required for QML demonstrations. These specifications ensure consistent and reproducible build and execution environments for all demos.

## Overview

Managing dependencies is crucial for the reliability and reproducibility of our QML demonstrations. This directory contains dedicated files that define the precise versions of packages used in different contextsâ€”ranging from development builds to stable releases and core execution requirements.

## Dependency Files

The following files define the various dependency sets:

### `constraints-dev.txt`

This file specifies the exact dependency versions used for building and running demonstrations when targeting the most recent **development builds** of PennyLane and its associated plugins. This ensures compatibility with cutting-edge features and ongoing development.

*   **Location:** `./constraints-dev.txt`
*   **Purpose:** Defines dependencies for the `qml build --dev` command.

### `constraints-stable.txt`

This file specifies the exact dependency versions used for building and running demonstrations against the most recent **stable release** of PennyLane and its associated plugins. This ensures compatibility and stability for production-ready demonstrations.

*   **Location:** `./constraints-stable.txt`
*   **Purpose:** Defines dependencies for the `qml build --no-dev` (default) command.

### `requirements-build.txt`

This file lists the dependencies specifically required for the build process of the demo notebooks using Sphinx. These packages are essential for converting and rendering the Python scripts into web-viewable formats (HTML/JSON).

*   **Location:** `./requirements-build.txt`
*   **Purpose:** Specifies tools needed for the Sphinx-based build system.

### `requirements-core.in`

This file specifies the fundamental execution dependencies that are automatically installed and available to **all** QML demonstrations by default. Demos can then specify additional, unique dependencies in their individual `requirements.in` files within their respective demo directories.

*   **Location:** `./requirements-core.in`
*   **Purpose:** Defines baseline dependencies for all demos.

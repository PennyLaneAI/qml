# Specifies constraints for PennyLane, Lightning, and Catalyst dev builds.
# These need to be installed separately, and in a specific order, and as such are not controlled 
# by the constraints-dev.txt file. Please do not change the order of these constraints.
# Use upper bounds targeting the next-to-next stable release so we continue to build RC branches during feature freeze.

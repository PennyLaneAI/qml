"""
Quantum embeddings and metric learning
======================================

**Authors: Maria Schuld and Aroosa Ijaz**

This tutorial illustrates the idea of quantum embeddings for metric
learning presented in `Lloyd, Schuld, Ijaz, Izaac, Killoran (2019) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03622>`_,
by training a hybrid classical-quantum data
embedding to classify images of ants and bees. The example was inspired
by `Mari et al. (2019) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08278>`_,
(see also this `tutorial <https://pennylane.ai/qml/app/tutorial_quantum_transfer_learning.html>`_),
and reproduces some of the subplots in Figure 5 of Lloyd et al.

# Idea
# ----
#
# Quantum metric learning trains a quantum embedding—for example, a
# quantum circuit that encodes classical data into quantum states—to
# separate different classes of data in the Hilbert space of the quantum
# system.
#
# .. figure:: ../implementations/embedding_metric_learning/training.png
#    :align: center
#    :width: 40%
#
# The trained embedding can be used for classification. A new data sample
# (red dot) gets mapped into Hilbert space via the same embedding, and a
# special measurement compares it to the two embedded classes.
# The decision boundary of the measurement in quantum state space is nearly
# linear (red dashed line).
#
# .. figure:: ../implementations/embedding_metric_learning/classification.png
#    :align: center
#    :width: 40%
#
# Since a simple metric in Hilbert space corresponds to a potentially much
# more complex metric in the original data space, the simple decision
# boundary can translate to a non-trivial decision boundary in the
# original space of the data.
#
# .. figure:: ../implementations/embedding_metric_learning/dec_boundary.png
#    :align: center
#    :width: 40%
#
# The best quantum measurement one could construct to classify new inputs
# depends on the loss defined for the classification task, as well as the
# metric used to optimize the separation of data.
#
# For a linear cost function, data separated by the trace distance or
# :math:`\ell_1` metric is best distinguished by a Helstrom measurement, while
# data separated by the Hilbert-Schmidt distance or :math:`\ell_2` metric
# is best classified by a fidelity measurement. Here we show how to
# implement training and classification based on the :math:`\ell_2`
# metric.
#
# Embedding
# ---------
#
# A quantum embedding is a representation of data points :math:`x` from a
# data domain :math:`X` as a *(quantum) feature state*
# :math:`| x \rangle`. Either the full embedding, or part of it, can be
# facilitated by a "quantum feature map", a quantum circuit
# :math:`\Phi(x)` that depends on the input. If the circuit has additional
# parameters :math:`\theta` that are adaptable,
# :math:`\Phi = \Phi(x, \theta)`, the quantum feature map can be trained
# via optimization.
#
# In this tutorial we investigate a trainable, hybrid classical-quantum embedding
# implemented by a partially pre-trained classical neural network,
# followed by a parametrized quantum circuit that implements the quantum
# feature map:
#
# |
#
# .. figure:: ../implementations/embedding_metric_learning/pipeline.png
#    :align: center
#    :width: 100%
#
# |
#
# Following `Mari et al. (2019) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08278>`__,
# for the classical neural network we use PyTorch's
# ``torch.models.resnet18()``, setting ``pretrained=True``. The final
# layer of the ResNet, which usually maps a 512-dimensional vector to 1000
# nodes representing different image classes, is replaced by a linear
# layer of 2 output neurons. The classical part of the embedding therefore
# maps the images to a 2-dimensional *intermediate feature space*.
#
# For the quantum part we use the QAOA embedding proposed
# in `Lloyd et al. (2019) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03622>`_.
# The feature map is represented by a layered variational circuit, which
# alternates a "feature-encoding Hamiltonian" and an "Ising-like" Hamiltonian
# with ZZ-entanglers (the two-qubit gates in the circuit diagram above) and ``RY`` gates as local fields.

def feature_encoding_hamiltonian(features, wires):

    for idx, w in enumerate(wires):
        RX(features[idx], wires=w)

def ising_hamiltonian(weights, wires, l):

        # ZZ coupling
        CNOT(wires=wires)
        RZ(2 * weights[l, 0], wires=wires[0])
        CNOT(wires=wires)
        # local fields
        for w in wires:
            RY(weights[l, i + 1], wires=w)

def QAOAEmbedding(features, weights, wires):

    repeat = len(weights)
    for l in range(repeat):
        # apply alternating Hamiltonians
        feature_encoding_hamiltonian(features, wires)
        ising_hamiltonian(weights, wires, l)
    # repeat the feature encoding once more at the end
    feature_encoding_hamiltonian(features, wires)

# Overall, the embedding has 1024 + 12 trainable parameters - 1024 for the
# classical part of the model and 12 for the four layers of the QAOA
# embedding.
#
# .. note:: The pretrained neural network has already learned
#           to separate the data. The example does therefore not
#           make any claims on the performance of the embedding, but aims to
#           illustrate how a hybrid embedding can be trained.
#
# Data
# ----
#
# We consider a binary supervised learning problem with examples
# :math:`\{a_1,...a_{M_a}\} \subseteq X` from class :math:`A` and examples
# :math:`\{b_1,...b_{M_b}\} \subseteq X` from class :math:`B`. The data
# are images of ants (:math:`A`) and bees (:math:`B`), taken from `Kaggle's
# hymenoptera dataset <https://www.kaggle.com/ajayrana/hymenoptera-data>`__.
# This is a sample of four images:
#
# .. figure:: ../implementations/embedding_metric_learning/data_example.png
#    :align: center
#    :width: 50%
#
# For convenience, instead of coding up the classical neural network, we
# load `pre-extracted feature vectors of the images
# <https://github.com/XanaduAI/qml/blob/master/implementations/embedding_metric_learning/X_antbees.txt>`_.
# These were created by
# resizing, cropping and normalizing the images, and passing them through
# PyTorch's pretrained ResNet 512 (that is, without the final linear
# layer).
#

X = np.loadtxt("embedding_metric_learning/X_antbees.txt", ndmin=2)  #1  pre-extracted inputs
Y = np.loadtxt("embedding_metric_learning/Y_antbees.txt")  # labels
X_val = np.loadtxt(
    "embedding_metric_learning/X_antbees_test.txt", ndmin=2
)  # pre-extracted validation inputs

# Cost
# ----
#
# The distance metric underlying the notion of 'separation' is the
# :math:`\ell_2` or Hilbert-Schmidt norm, which depends on overlaps of
# the embedded data points :math:`|a\rangle`
# from class :math:`A` and :math:`|b\rangle` from class :math:`B`,
#
# .. math::
#
#     D_{\mathrm{hs}}(A, B) =  \frac{1}{2} \big( \sum_{i, i'} |\langle a_i|a_{i'}\rangle|^2
#        +  \sum_{j,j'} |\langle b_j|b_{j'}\rangle|^2 \big)
#        - \sum_{i,j} |\langle a_i|b_j\rangle|^2.
#
# To maximize the :math:`\ell_2` distance between the two classes in
# Hilbert space, we minimize the cost
# :math:`C = 1 - \frac{1}{2}D_{\mathrm{hs}}(A, B)`.
#
# To set up the "quantum part" of the cost function in PennyLane, we have
# to create a quantum node. Here, the quantum node is simulated on
# PennyLane's ``'default.qubit'`` backend.
#
# .. note:: One could also connect the
#           quantum node to a hardware backend to find out if the noise of a
#           physical implementation still allows us to train the embedding.

# Classification
# --------------
#
# Given a new input :math:`x \in X`, and its quantum feature state
# :math:`|x \rangle`, the trained embedding can be used to solve the
# binary classification problem of assigning :math:`x` to either :math:`A`
# or :math:`B`. For an embedding separating data via the :math:`\ell_2`
# metric, a very simple measurement can be used for classification: one
# computes the overlap of :math:`|x \rangle` with examples of
# :math:`|a \rangle` and :math:`|b \rangle`. :math:`x` is assigned to the
# class with which it has a larger average overlap in the space of the
# embedding.
#
# Let us consider a picture of an ant from the validation set (assuming
# our model never saw it during training):

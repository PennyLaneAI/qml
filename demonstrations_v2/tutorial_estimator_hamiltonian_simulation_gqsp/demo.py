r"""Resource estimation for Hamiltonian simulation with GQSP
============================================================

Simulating the time evolution of a quantum system is the most useful problem with an exponential quantum speedup. 
This task is known as **Hamiltonian simulation**, and it is the main subroutine in quantum algorithms for chemistry,
materials science, and condensed matter physics. Multiple strategies exist
with unique strengths and weaknesses, but the best asymptotic scaling is achieved by methods based on quantum
signal processing (QSP) [#qsp]_. Quantifying the precise constant-factor cost of these algorithms is challenging, 
as we need to compute the cost of block encoding Hamiltonians and identify the correct phase factors as
a function of evolution time and target errors. Well, at least it used to be challenging.

In this demo, we showcase how to use PennyLane's estimator module to compute the cost of Hamiltonian simulation
with QSP, making it simple to determine how useful it is for your application of interest. We focus 
on the modern framework of **generalized quantum signal processing (GQSP)** and study examples of resource estimation
for a simple spin model and for a Heisenberg Hamiltonian for NMR spectral prediction. More information on QSP 
can be found in our other demos:

Hamiltonian simulation with GQSP
--------------------------------
QSP is a method for performing polynomial transformations of 
block-encoded operators. It consists of a (i) sequence of interleaving *signal* operators that perform the 
block-encoding, and (ii) single-qubit *signal-processing* operators that define the polynomial.
GQSP expands on the original approach by considering signal-processing operators that are general 
:math:`SU(2)` transformations; this removes restrictions on available polynomial transformations
and facilitates solving for the :math:`SU(2)` *phase factors*, making it the modern method of choice [#gqsp]_.
 
Hamiltonian simulation is the task of implementing the time-evolution operator :math:`e^{-iHt}`.
We do this for an input Hamiltonian :math:`H` and a target evolution time :math:`t`, subject to a target error 
:math:`\varepsilon`.
GQSP solves this challenge by expressing the complex exponential :math:`e^{-iHt}` as a polynomial, 
truncated to a degree determined by :math:`t` and :math:`\varepsilon`. The corresponding 
transformation is then implemented on a block-encoding of :math:`H`. 

In practice it is customary to instead block-encode :math:`e^{-i\arccos (H)t}` and approximate the 
function :math:`e^{-i\cos (H)t}` through the rapidly-converging Jacobi-Anger expansion [#gqsp]_. 
This type of block-encoding is a **qubitization** of the Hamiltonian. It can be implemented by a 
sequence of Prepare and Select operators that are induced by a `linear combination of unitaries 
(LCU) decomposition <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_lcu_blockencoding>`_. 
We refer to this block encoding as a **walk operator**.

Let's explore how to use PennyLane to estimate the cost of Hamiltonian simulation with GQSP.

Spin dynamics
-------------
We focus on the XX model Hamiltonian with no external field, defined as

.. math::

    H_{XX} = -  \sum_{i,j=1}^{N} J_{ij} (X_i X_j + Y_iY_j),

where :math:`X,Y` are Pauli matrices acting on a given spin site and :math:`N` is the number of spins. 
The coefficients :math:`J_{ij}` can be interpreted as the adjacency matrix of a graph that defines the
coupling between spins. Generating samples from a time-evolved state under this Hamiltonian (as well as 
many other spin models) is widely believed to be an intractable classical problem [#spin]. **But what is 
the cost of performing this simulation on a quantum computer?** More specifically: how many qubits 
and gates are needed to perform Hamiltonian simulation with GQSP on a square 
grid of :math:`100\times 100` spins?

To answer this, we first define the Hamiltonian. For the purpose of resource estimation, the specific coupling coefficients are
unimportant since the algorithm works identically regardless of their concrete value. This allows us to define 
**compact Hamiltonians** that are easy to instantiate by specifying only the type and number of Pauli operators.
With periodic boundary conditions, each spin site on the lattice is coupled to four nearest neighbours, so
we have 10,000 qubits with 40,000 XX and YY couplings respectively. This information is defined as a
dictionary and passed directly to the `PauliHamiltonian` resource operator:

    num_qubits = 10000, # 100*100

# Heisenberg model for NMR spectral prediction
# --------------------------------------------
# We follow work presented in Ref. [#nmr] describing quantum simulation of NMR in the zero-to-ultralow field regime. 
# The main computational task is to simulate time evolution under a Heisienberg Hamiltonian of the form
#
# .. math::
#   H = \sum_{k\neq l} J_{kl}\vec{\sigma}_k\cdot \vec{\sigma}_l + D_{kl}^{\alpha \beta}\sigma^\alpha_k\sigma^\beta_l 
#   - \sum_k\vec{h}_k\cdot \vec{\sigma}_k,
#
# where the sums over :math:`k,l` run over spin sites, and the sum over :math:`\alpha, beta` run through
# spatial directions :math:`x,y`, and :math:`z``. We're using the notation
#
# .. math::
#   \vec{\sigma}\cdot \vec{\sigma} = \sigma_{x}\sigma_{x}+\sigma_{y}\sigma_{y}+\sigma_{z}\sigma_{z}.
#
# As before, we build a compact Hamiltonian representation by counting the number of Pauli operators of
# each kind, which is straightforward from expanding the Hamiltonian. For :math:`N` spins, sums over :math:`k\neq l`
# run over :math:`N(N-1)/2` terms, and there are 6 possible pairs of Pauli matrices when we account for 
# anti-commutation. The last sum over :math:`k` contains :math:`N` terms of 3 different Paulis. 
# We study a system of :math:`N=32` spins as in the paper, which gives the following compact Hamiltonian:

# Conclusion
# ----------
# Hamiltonian simulation with GQSP is a well-established quantum algorithm with many useful applications. 
# It consists of multiple subroutines that may require time to master, but PennyLane elegantly aggregates them into 
# easy-to-use operations. These allows us to rapidly and accurately quantify
# resources for specific use cases. Users also have the flexibility to customize the algorithm by leveraging
# the full breadth of capabilities offered as part of PennyLane's `estimator` module, for example by constructing
# custom Prepare and Select operators and studying other systems of interest, such as electronic structure, 
# vibrational, and vibronic Hamiltonians.

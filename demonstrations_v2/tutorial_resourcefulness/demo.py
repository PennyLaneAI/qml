Resourcefulness of quantum states with Fourier analysis
=======================================================

Resource theories in quantum information ask how "complex" a given quantum state is with respect to a certain
measure of complexity. For example, using the resource of *entanglement*, we can ask how entangled a quantum state is. Other well-known
resources are: *Clifford stabilizerness*, which measures how close a state is from being preparable by a
classically simulatable *Clifford circuit*, and *Gaussianity*, which quantifies the distance of a state from simple *Gaussian states*.
As the name "resourceful" suggests,
these measures of complexity often relate to the "effort" or cost associated with states, wether that be the complexity of classical simulation or the difficulty of preparation in the lab.

It turns out that the resourcefulness of quantum states can be investigated with tools from *generalised Fourier analysis*.
*Fourier analysis* here refers to the well-known technique of computing Fourier coefficients of a function, or in our case,
the amplitudes of a quantum state. *Generalised* indicates that we don't use the
standard Fourier transform, but a generalisation of its group-theoretic definition (more about this in our demo on `quantum Fourier transforms
and groups <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qft_and_groups>`__).
`Bermejo, Braccia et al. (2025) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19696>`__ [#Bermejo_Braccia]_ suggest using generalised Fourier analysis to
compute a quantity that they call the **Generalised Fourier Decomposition (GFD) Purity**,
and use it as a "fingerprint" of a state's resource profile.

To give a sneak peek of the technical details, the idea is to identify the circuits that map resource-free
states to other resource-free states with a mathematical object called a *unitary representation of a group*.
The basis in which these "free" unitaries, and hence the representation, are block-diagonal reveals so-called *irreducible subspaces*
of different "order".
The GFD Purities then serve as a measure of how much of a state "lives" in each of these subspaces.
More resourceful states have large projections in higher-order subspaces and vice versa.

To clarify this terminology, we will begin with a didactic example, and see that the standard Fourier
transform can be seen as a special case of this framework: here
the GFD purities are the absolute squares of the standard Fourier coefficients,
which is also known as the *power spectrum* (and GFD Purities can therefore be seen as a "generalised power spectrum") .
We will then use the same concepts to analyse the entanglement fingerprint
of quantum states as a resource, reproducing Figure 2 in [#Bermejo_Braccia]_.

   Figure 1: The three GFD Purities of different states using 2-qubit entanglement as a resource.
   A Bell state, which is maximally entangled, has high contributions in second-order GFD Purities, while
   a tensor product state with no entanglement has contributions in the first-order Purities. The interpolation
   between the two extremes, exemplified by an ensemble of Haar random states, lies in between.

While the underlying theory is rooted in group theory, this tutorial is aimed at readers who don't know much about groups. 
Instead, we will make heavy use of linear algebra!


Standard Fourier analysis through the lens of resources
-------------------------------------------------------

The power spectrum as GFD Purities
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Let's start by recalling the `standard discrete Fourier transform <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform>`__.
Given N real values :math:`x_0,...,x_{N-1}`, that we can interpret as the values
of a function :math:`f(x)` over the integers :math:`x \in {0,...,N-1}`, the discrete Fourier transform
computes the Fourier coefficients

.. math:: \hat{f}(k) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{x=0}^{N-1} f(x) e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{N} k x}, \;\; k = 0,...,N-1.

In words, the Fourier coefficients are projections of :math:`f(x)` onto the *Fourier basis functions*
:math:`e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{N} k x}`. Note that we use a normalisation here that is consistent with a unitary transform.

Let's see this equation in action.

######################################################################
# The function with the least resource is constant! This makes sense: We know that the decay of the Fourier coefficients
# is related to the number of continuous derivatives it has, which in turn is the technical definition of "smoothness".
# A constant function is maximally smooth---it does not wiggle at all. In other words,
# the resource of the standard Fourier transform is non-smoothness, and a resource-free function is constant.
#

######################################################################
# The general recipe
# ++++++++++++++++++
#
# Computing the GFD Purities for the resource of smoothness was very simple. We will now view it from a much more complicated
# perspective, but one whose machinery will allow us to calculate the GFD Purities for
# more advanced resources like quantum entanglement.
#
# 1. Identify free vectors
# ************************
# The first step to compute GFD Purities is to define the resource by identifying a set of "resource-free vectors".
# (We need vectors because representation theory deals with vector spaces.)
# So far we have only had a discrete *function* :math:`f(x)`,
# but we can easily write it as a vector :math:`[f(0), ..., f(N-1)]^T \in V` living in the vector space :math:`\mathbb{R}^N`.
#

f_vec = np.array([f(x) for x in range(N)])

######################################################################
# As argued above,
# the set of resource-free vectors corresponds to constant functions, :math:`f(0) = ... = f(N-1)`, or uniform vectors
# that have the same entry everywhere.
#
# 2. Identify free unitary transformations
# ****************************************
# Next, we need to identify a set of unitary matrices (think: quantum circuits) that, when multiplied by the resource-free vectors,
# map to another resource-free vector. Which matrices map uniform vectors to uniform vectors?
# The permutation matrices! These are matrices that, by definition,
# swap the entries of the vector, but do not change their magnitude.
#
# 3. Identify a group representation
# **********************************
# This is the most difficult step, which sometimes requires a lot of group-theoretic knowledge. Essentially, we have to associate
# the unitary transformations, or at least a subset of them, with a *unitary representation of a group*.
#
# .. admonition:: Unitary representation
#     :class: note
#
#     A representation is a matrix-valued function :math:`R(g), g \in G` on a group :math:`G` with the
#     property that :math:`R(g) R(g') = R(gg')`, where :math:`gg'` denotes the composition of elements according
#     to the group.
#
# Without dwelling further, we simply recognise that the *circulant* permutation matrices---those that shift vector
# entries by :math:`s` positions---can be shown to
# form a unitary representation for the group :math:`g \in G = Z_N`. This representation is called the *regular representation*.
# Every circulant matrix hence gets associated with one x-value.
#
# .. admonition:: The group :math:`Z_N`
#     :class: note
#
#     The "cyclic" group :math:`Z_N`
#     are the integers from 0 to N-1 under addition modulo N.
#
# Here is the circulant permutation matrix that shifts entries in ``f_vec`` by two positions:
#

shift = 2

first_row = np.zeros(N)
first_row[shift] = 1

# initialize the matrix with the first row
P = np.zeros((N, N))
P[0, :] = first_row

# generate subsequent rows by cyclically shifting the previous row
for i in range(1, N):
    P[i, :] = np.roll(P[i-1, :], 1)

print(P)


######################################################################
# 4. Find the basis that block-diagonalises the representation
# ************************************************************
# This was quite a bit of group jargon, but for a good reason: We are now guaranteed that there is
# a basis change that block-diagonalises *all* circulant permutation matrices, or more generally,
# all resource-free unitaries :math:`R(g)` identified in Step 2. If you know group theory,
# then you will recognise that the blocks reveal the *irreducible representations* of the group.
# In more general linear algebra language, the blocks form different *irreducible subspaces* which we need in order to compute
# the GFD Purities in the next step.
#
# In our toy case, and as for all *Abelian* groups, the blocks are 1-dimensional, and the basis
# change *diagonalises* every matrix of the representation. And, this is the crucial point, the basis change
# is nothing other than the discrete Fourier transform!
#
# In matrix notation, the Fourier transform implemented in ``f_hat`` looks as follows:
#
# .. math::
#      F = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \begin{bmatrix}
#            1&1&1&1&\cdots &1 \\
#            1&\omega&\omega^2&\omega^3&\cdots&\omega^{N-1} \\
#            1&\omega^2&\omega^4&\omega^6&\cdots&\omega^{2(N-1)}\\ 1&\omega^3&\omega^6&\omega^9&\cdots&\omega^{3(N-1)}\\
#            \vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
#            1&\omega^{N-1}&\omega^{2(N-1)}&\omega^{3(N-1)}&\cdots&\omega^{(N-1)(N-1)}
#           \end{bmatrix}
#
# Let's quickly check that multiplying ``f_vec`` with this matrix produces the Fourier coefficients computed above.
# For convenience, we get the matrix from scipy, but have to normalise it.
#

from scipy.linalg import dft
F = dft(N)/np.sqrt(N)
f_fourier_coeffs2 = F @ f_vec

print("Fourier coefficients coincide:", np.allclose(f_fourier_coeffs, f_fourier_coeffs2))

######################################################################
# Now, where are we? We wanted to show that our group-theoretic claim is true:
# Expressing any circulant matrix ``P`` in the Fourier basis---or multiplying it with the basis change matrix ``F``---
# diagonalises it.
#

np.set_printoptions(precision=2, suppress=True)
P_F =  np.linalg.inv(F) @ P @ F

# check if the resulting matrix is diagonal
# trick: remove diagonal and make sure the remainder is zero
print("is diagonal:", np.allclose(P_F - np.diag(np.diagonal(P_F)), np.zeros((N,N)) ))

######################################################################
# In fact, the Fourier transform is sometimes *defined* as the basis change that diagonalises the regular representation!
# For other representations, however, we need other basis transforms.
#
# 5. Find a basis for each subspace
# *********************************
# What we actually wanted to accomplish with the (block-)diagonalisation was to find the subspaces associated with each block.
# According to standard linear algebra, a basis for such a subspace can be found by selecting the rows of the basis change matrix
# ``F`` whose indices correspond to the indices of a block in ``P_F``.
#
# In [#Bermejo_Braccia]_, these basis vectors were
# called :math:`w^{(i)}_{\alpha, j}`, where :math:`\alpha` indicates the block, :math:`j` refers to the multiplicity
# of that block (which can potentially be repeated, a technical detail we will not worry about any further here), and
# :math:`i` indexes the basis vectors.
# For example, the single basis vector spanning the 1-dimensional subspace that corresponds to the third 1-dimensional block
# in ``P_F`` would be:
#

basis3 = F[3: 4]
print(basis3)

######################################################################
# 6. Compute the GFD Purities
# ***************************
# We can now compute the GFD Purities according to Eq. (5) in [#Bermejo_Braccia]_.
#
# .. math::
#           \mathcal{P}_{\alpha, j}(v) = \sum_i  | \langle w^{(i)}_{\alpha, j}, v \rangle |^2,
#
# where :math:`v` is the vector whose
# resource fingerprint we want to determine.
#
# For example, the GFD Purity for the third block (or "frequency") for the vector ``f_vec`` would be calculated as follows:
#

purity3 = np.abs(np.vdot(basis3, f_vec))**2

######################################################################
# What did we just do? We wrote a discrete function as a vector and computed the magnitude of its projection onto
# a subspace spanned by a row of ``F``, the matrix that moves into the Fourier basis. This is exactly what we
# did when computing the power spectrum. We have indeed just made the recipe for computing the power
# spectrum more complicated. To confirm this, let's verify that the third entry of the power spectrum
# is the third GFD Purity.
#

print("GFD Purity and power spectrum coincide:", np.isclose(power_spectrum[3], purity3))

######################################################################
# We now have a very different perspective on the power spectrum :math:`|\hat{f}(k)|^2`: It is a projection of the function
# :math:`f` into irreducible subspaces revealed by moving into the basis that block-diagonalises circulant matrices.
# The advantage of this perspective is that it easily generalises to other resources, groups and vector spaces,
# as long as we can follow Steps 1-6.
#
# Let's now try to compute entanglement fingerprints, or "generalised power spectra" of quantum states.
#
# .. admonition:: Note
#     :class: note
#
#     Before moving on, we want to remark that the example of "non-smoothness" as a resource should be read as a pedagogical, and not rigorous, introduction to the idea of the GFD framework.
#     For example, a subtlety arises when we speak of "high" and "low-order" frequencies. Commonly, GFD purities are ordered by taking into account the size of their associated blocks in the block-diagonalisation of representations.
#     However, in our Fourier transform example, we were working with *Abelian groups*, where all blocks are of dimension 1. 
#     To derive the order of frequencies a more complicated theoretical construction is required, which exceeds the scope of this demo.
#

######################################################################
# Fourier analysis of entanglement
# --------------------------------
#
# We want to apply what we learnt so far to the most popular resource of quantum states: multipartite entanglement.
# One can think of multipartite entanglement as a resource of the state of a quantum system that measures how "wiggly"
# the correlations between its constituents are.
# While this is a general statement, we will restrict our attention to systems made of our favourite quantum objects, qubits.
# Just like smoother functions have Fourier spectra concentrated in the low-order frequencies,
# quantum states with simpler entanglement structures, or no entanglement at all like in the case of product states,
# have generalized Fourier spectra with large lower-order coefficients.
#
# First, we can define a few states with different entanglement properties that we will use below:
#
# * **Product state**: A resource-free state with no entanglement. We use Haar random states for the single qubit states.
# * **GHZ state**: A highly structured, maximally entangled state, which generalises Bell states to more qubits.
#   It behaves like a quantum analog of a high-frequency oscillation.
# * **Random (Haar) state**: Highly complex state, but without structured entanglement patterns.
#
# In the code examples we'll show shortly, you'll see how the different entanglement properties reflect in the GFD Purity spectrum.
# But for now, let us create
# example states for these categories:
#


import pennylane as qml
from scipy.stats import unitary_group


dev = qml.device("default.qubit")

@qml.qnode(dev)
def product_state(n_qubits):
    for i in range(n_qubits):
        U_haar = unitary_group.rvs(2)
        qml.QubitUnitary(U_haar, wires=i)
    return qml.state()

@qml.qnode(dev)
def haar_state(n_qubits):
    U_haar = unitary_group.rvs(2**n_qubits)
    qml.QubitUnitary(U_haar, wires=range(n_qubits))
    return qml.state()

@qml.qnode(dev)
def ghz_state(n_qubits):
    qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
    for i in range(1, n_qubits):
        qml.CNOT(wires=[0, i])
    return qml.state()

n = 2
states = [product_state(n),  haar_state(n), ghz_state(n)]
labels = [ "Product", "Haar", "GHZ"]

#####################################################################
# To compute the GFD Purities, we can walk the same steps we took when studying the resource of "non-smoothness".
#
# 1. **Identify free vectors**. Luckily for us, our objects of interest, the quantum states :math:`|\psi\rangle \in \mathbb{C}^{2n}`,
#    are already in the form of vectors. It's easy to define the set of free states for multipartite entanglement:
#    product states, or tensor products of single-qubit quantum states.
#
# 2. **Identify free unitary transformations**. Now, what unitary transformation of a quantum state does not generate
#    entanglement? You guessed it right, "non-entangling" circuits that consist only of single-qubit
#    gates :math:`U=\bigotimes_j U_j` for  :math:`U_j \in SU(2)`.
#
# 3. **Identify a group representation**. It turns out that non-entangling unitaries are the standard representation
#    of the group :math:`G = SU(2) \times \dots \times SU(2)` for the vector space :math:`H`,
#    the Hilbert space of the state vectors.
#    Again, this implies that we can find a basis of the Hilbert space where any non-entangling unitary :math:`U`
#    is simultaneously block-diagonal.
#
# 4. **Find the basis that block-diagonalises the representation**.
#
# Let's stop here for now, and try to block-diagonalise one of the non-entangling unitaries. We can use an
# eigenvalue decomposition for this.
#

from scipy.stats import unitary_group
from functools import reduce

# create n haar random single-qubit unitaries
Us = [unitary_group.rvs(dim=2) for _ in range(n)]
# compose them into a non-entangling n-qubit unitary
U = reduce(lambda A, B: np.kron(A, B), Us)

# block-diagonalise
vals, U_bdiag = np.linalg.eig(U)

print(U_bdiag)

######################################################################
# Wait, this is not a block-diagonal matrix, even if we'd shuffle the rows and columns. What is happening here?
#
# Unfortunately, the non-entangling unitary matrices only have a *single* block of size :math:`2^n \times 2^n`.
# Technically speaking, the representation is *irreducible* over the Hilbert space :math:`H`.
# As a consequence, the invariant subspace is :math:`H` itself, and the single GFD Purity is simply the purity of
# the state :math:`|\psi\rangle`, which is 1.
# This, of course, is not a very informative fingerprint -- one that is much too coarse!
#
# However, we have freedom to define the vector spaces for the fingerprint.
# It turns out that considering the space :math:`B(H)` of bounded linear operators, in which density matrices live, leads to
# a much more nuanced generalised Fourier spectrum. Although this space contains matrices, it is a vector space in the technical sense.
# This requires some mental gymnastics, but we can think of flattening all density matrices, and turning
# operators acting *on* density matrices into other operators that act on the flattened 1-dimensional vectors. In fact,
# this is exactly what we will do in all numerical simulations.
#
# So, let us walk the steps from above once more, but this time with density matrices.
# First, we turn the example states into density matrices.
#

states = [np.outer(state, state.conj()) for state in states]

######################################################################
# Next, we follow the recipe to compute the GFD Purities.
#
# 1. **Identify free vectors**.
#    Our free vectors are still product states, only that now we represent them as density matrices :math:`\rho = \bigotimes_j \rho_j`.
#    But to use the linear algebra tricks from before we have
#    to "vectorize" density matrices :math:`\rho=\sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} |i\rangle \langle j|`
#    to have the form :math:`|\rho\rangle \rangle = \sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} |i\rangle |j\rangle \in H \otimes H^*` (something
#    you might have encountered before in the *Choi formalism*, where the "double bracket notation" stems from).
#    For example:
#

# create a random quantum state
psi = np.random.rand(2**n) + 1j*np.random.rand(2**n)
psi = psi/np.linalg.norm(psi)

# construct the corresponding density matrix
rho = np.outer(psi, psi.conj())

# vectorise it
rho_vec = rho.flatten(order='F')

######################################################################
#
# 2. **Identify free unitary transformations**.
#    The free operations are still given by non-entangling unitaries, but
#    of course, they act on density matrices via :math:`\rho' = U \rho U^{\dagger}`.
#    We can also vectorise this operation by defining the matrix :math:`U_{\mathrm{vec}} = U \otimes U^*`.
#    We then have that :math:`|\rho'\rangle \rangle = U_{\mathrm{vec}} |\rho\rangle \rangle`.
#    To demonstrate:
#

# vectorise U
Uvec = np.kron(U.conj(), U)

# evolve the state above by U, using the vectorised objects
rho_out_vec = Uvec @ rho_vec

# reshape the result back into a density matrix
rho_out = np.reshape(rho_out_vec, (2**n, 2**n), order='F')

# this is the same as the usual adjoint application of U
print(np.allclose(rho_out, U @ rho @ U.conj().T ))

######################################################################
# 3. **Identify a group representation**.
#    This "adjoint action" is indeed a valid representation of
#    :math:`G = SU(2) \times \dots \times SU(2)`, called the *defining representation*. However, it is a different one from before,
#    and this time there is a basis transformation that properly block-diagonalises all matrices in the representation.
#
# 4. **Find the basis that block-diagonalises the representation**.
#    To find this basis we compute the eigendecomposition of an arbitrary linear combination
#    of a set of matrices in the representation.
#
rng = np.random.default_rng(42)

Uvecs = []
for i in range(10):
    # create n haar random single-qubit unitaries
    Ujs = [unitary_group.rvs(dim=2, random_state=rng) for _ in range(n)]
    # compose them into a non-entangling n-qubit unitary
    U = reduce(lambda A, B: np.kron(A, B), Ujs)
    # Vectorise U
    Uvec = np.kron(U.conj(), U)
    Uvecs.append(Uvec)

# Create a random linear combination of the matrices
alphas = rng.random(len(Uvecs)) + 1j * rng.random(len(Uvecs))
M_combo = sum(a * M for a, M in zip(alphas, Uvecs))

# Eigendecompose the linear combination
vals, Q = np.linalg.eig(M_combo)

######################################################################
# Let's test this basis change with one of the vectorized unitaries:
#

Uvec = Uvecs[0]
Qinv = np.linalg.inv(Q)
Uvec_diag = Qinv @ Uvec @ Q

np.set_printoptions(
    formatter={'float': lambda x: f"{x:5.2g}"},
    linewidth=200,    # default is 75; increase to fit your array
    threshold=10000   # so it doesn’t summarize large arrays
)

# print the absolute values for better illustration
print(np.round(np.abs(Uvec_diag), 4))

######################################################################
# But ``Uvec_diag`` does not look block diagonal. What happened here?
# Well, it *is* block-diagonal, but we have to reorder the columns and rows of the final matrix to make this visible.
# This takes a bit of pain, which we outsource to a utility function that can be found
# `here <https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/qml/demonstrations_v2/tutorial_resourcefulness/utils.py>`__:
#

from utils import group_rows_cols_by_sparsity

P_row, P_col = group_rows_cols_by_sparsity(Uvec_diag)

# reorder the block-diagonalising matrices
Q = Q @ P_col
Qinv = P_row @ Qinv

Uvec_diag = Qinv @ Uvec @ Q

print(np.round(np.abs(Uvec_diag), 4))


######################################################################
# The reordering made the block structure visible. You can check that now any vectorized non-entangling matrix ``Uvec``
# has the same block structure if we change the basis via ``Qinv @ Uvec @ Q``.
#
# But we need one last cosmetic modification that will help us below: We want to turn ``Q`` into a unitary transformation.
# This can be done using a Singular Value Decomposition.
#

U, s, Vh = np.linalg.svd(Q, full_matrices=False)
# redefine Q as a unitary basis transformation
Q = U @ Vh
Qinv = np.linalg.inv(Q)

######################################################################
# Having found the basis that block-diagonalises the resource-free unitaries, we can
# proceed with our recipe.
#
# 5. **Find a basis for each subspace**.
#    As mentioned before, the basis of a subspace corresponding to a block are just the rows of the unitary basis change
#    matrix ``Q`` that correspond to the row/column
#    indices of the block.
#
# 6. **Compute the GFD Purities**

# The point here is that while multipartite entanglement can get complex very quickly as we
# add qubits (due to the exponential increase in possible correlations),
# our generalized Fourier analysis still provides a clear, intuitive fingerprint of a state's entanglement structure.
# Even more intriguingly, just as smoothness guides how we compress classical
# signals (by discarding higher-order frequencies), the entanglement fingerprint suggests ways of how we might compress quantum states,
# discarding information in higher-order purities to simplify quantum simulations and measurements.
#

###########################################################################
# In short, generalized Fourier transforms allow us to understand quantum complexity,
# much like classical Fourier transforms give insight into smoothness.
# By reading a state's "quantum Fourier" fingerprint, the GFD Purities, we gain a clear window into the
# subtle quantum world of multipartite entanglement. We now know that 
# computing these purities, once a problem has been defined in terms of representations, is just a matter of 
# standard linear algebra. 
#
# Of course, we can only hope to compute the GFD Purities for small system sizes, as the matrices involved scale
# rapidly with the number of qubits. It is a fascinating question in which
# situations they could be estimated by a quantum algorithm, since many efficient quantum algorithms
# for the block-diagonalisation of representations are known, such as the Quantum Fourier Transform or
# the quantum Schur transform.

# Bonus section
# --------------
#
# If your head is not spinning yet, let's ask a final, and rather instructive, question.
# What basis have we actually changed into in the above example of multi-partite entanglement?
# It turns out that ``Q`` changes into the Pauli basis!
# To see this, we take the Pauli basis matrices, vectorise them and compare each one with the
# subspace basis vectors in ``Q``.

# When one thinks about this a little more, it is not surprising that ``Q`` changes into our favourite quantum computing
# basis. The Pauli basis has a structure
# that considers the qubits separately, and entanglement is likewise related to subsystems of qubits that interact. However,
# recognising the generalised Fourier basis as the Pauli basis provides an intuition for the subspaces and their order:
# GFD purities measure how much of a state lives in a given subset of qubits!

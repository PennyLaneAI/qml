Molecular Hamiltonians in second quantization can be constructed in different ways depending on the
arrangement of the two-electron integral tensor. Here, we show you how to construct a fermionic
molecular Hamiltonian from two-electron integral tensors represented in different conventions. The
integrals computed with any of these conventions can be easily converted to the others. This allows
constructing any desired representation of the molecular Hamiltonian without re-calculating the
integrals. We start by a detailed step-by-step construction of the integrals, and the corresponding
Hamiltonians, and then provide compact helper functions that automate the conversion of the
integrals and the construction of the Hamiltonains.

# Integral Notations
# ------------------
# We use three common notations for two-electron integrals. First, we look at a notation that is
# commonly used in the quantum computing community and quantum software libraries, which we refer to
# as the ``Quantum`` notation. Then we review two other notations that are typically referred to as
# the ``Chemist's`` and ``Physicist's`` notations.
#
# Quantum notation
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# The two-electron integrals in this notation are defined as
#
# .. math::
#
#     \langle \langle pq | rs \rangle \rangle = \int dr_1 dr_2 \phi_p^*(r_1) \phi_q^*(r_2) \frac{1}{r_{12}} \phi_r(r_2) \phi_s(r_1),
#
# where :math:`\phi` is a spatial molecular orbital. We have used the double bracket
# :math:`\langle \langle \cdot  \rangle \rangle` to distinguish this notation from the others. The
# corresponding Hamiltonian in second quantization is defined in terms of the fermionic creation and
# annihilation operators, :math:`a^{\dagger}` and :math:`a`, as
#
# .. math::
#
#     H = \sum_{pq} h_{pq} a_p^{\dagger} a_q + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{pqrs} h_{pqrs} a_p^{\dagger} a_q^{\dagger} a_r a_s.
#
# where :math:`h_{pq}` denotes a one-electron integral. We have skipped the spin indices and
# the core constant for brevity. Note that the order of the creation and annihilation operator
# indices matches the order of the coefficient indices for both :math:`h_{pq}` and :math:`h_{pqrs}`
# terms.
#
# We now construct the Hamiltonian using PennyLane. PennyLane employs the quantum computing
# convention for the two-electron integral tensor, which can be efficiently computed via the
# built-in ``electron_integrals`` function. We use the water molecule as an example.

# Appendix
# --------
# We use the molecular Hamiltonian corresponding to Physicist's convention to derive the Hamiltonian
# corresponding to the Chemist's convention. Recall the following anti-commutation rules for the
# fermionic creation and annihilation operators,
#
# .. math::
#
#     [a^{\dagger}_i, a^{\dagger}_j]_+ = 0, \:\:\:\:\:\:\: [a_i, a_j]_+=0, \:\:\:\:\:\:\: [a_i, a^{\dagger}_j]_+ = \delta_{ij} I,,
#
# where :math:`\delta_{ij}` and :math:`I` are the Kronecker delta and the identity operator,
# respectively. In the Hamiltonian represented by the Physicist's convention, we use these
# anti-commutation rules to move the :math:`a_r` operator from right to left. We first swap the
# operator with :math:`a_s` and then swap it again with :math:`a_q^{\dagger}`. This gives us the
# two-body term :math:`a_p^{\dagger} a_r a_q^{\dagger} a_s` and the one-body operator
# :math:`a_p^{\dagger} a_s`. We can re-arrange the indices to get the Hamiltonian in the Chemist's
# convention.

r"""Resource Estimation for X-ray Absorption and Photodynamic Therapy
=====================================================================
Spectroscopy is an indispensible measurement technique in chemistry and physics,
providing fundamental insights into the structure and dynamics of molecules and materials. However,
to extract these insights, it is often necessary to use simulations to interpret the experimentally
measured spectra. In practice, this requires exciting the system with an external electromagnetic
field---for example, visible light, or X-rays---and then simulating how the system's quantum state
evolves over time in response to that, described by its Hamiltonian. On classical computers,
this is notoriously expensive. The computational resources required to accurately model the excited
states of a complex molecule or material scale exponentially with system size, often pushing even
the most powerful supercomputers to their breaking point.

Can quantum computers do better?

In this demo, we answer that question by using PennyLane's resource :mod:`estimator <pennylane.estimator>`
to directly calculate the requirements for two distinct algorithmic approaches. Specifically, we calculate the resources for
Trotter-based time evolution for X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) and Qubitization-based spectral filtering
for Photodynamic Therapy (PDT). By estimating the costs of these algorithms now, we can
best prepare them for execution on future fault-tolerant hardware.

Simulating Spectroscopy on a Quantum Computer
---------------------------------------------

Our first challenge is to translate a physical spectroscopy experiment into a simulation performed with a quantum circuit.

Regardless of the specific spectroscopy being analyzed, whether it is X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) [#Fomichev2025]_,
Vibrational Spectroscopy [#Laoiza2025]_, or Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy [#Kunitsa2025]_, the
core goal is the same: calculating the time-domain correlation function, :math:`\tilde{G}(t)`.

To measure this observable on a quantum computer, we rely on a standard algorithmic template called the
**Hadamard Test**.

  Figure 1: *Circuit for XAS Simulation*

As we will see, the dominant cost in this circuit comes from the controlled time evolution block, the efficiency of which
dictates the feasibility of our algorithm. This cost is set by the physics of
the specific spectroscopy we are after, as well as the details of our implementation strategy.

While the physical problem of interest dictates the type of Hamiltonian we must use (such as electronic, vibrational),
we have significant freedom to optimize the implementation. For example, we can choose between different
Hamiltonian representations, as well as the algorithms for actually performing time evolution, like Trotterization
or `qubitization <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qubitization>`_.

We begin with the example of `X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_xas>`_, using
PennyLane's resource :mod:`estimator <pennylane.estimator>` to quantify the resource requirements.

X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy
-----------------------------
`XAS <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_xas>`_ is a spectroscopic method used to study the electronic
and local structural environment of specific elements within a material, by probing core-level electron excitations.
For this simulation, we follow the algorithm established in Fomichev et al. (2025) [#Fomichev2025]_,
which utilizes the `Compressed Double-Factorization (CDF) <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_how_to_build_compressed_double_factorized_hamiltonians>`_
representation of the electronic Hamiltonian combined with Trotterization.

To benchmark this approach, we focus on **Lithium Manganese (LiMn) oxide clusters**, which are
widely studied as critical cathode materials for next-generation batteries.

The first step to determining the resources for this simulation is to define the Hamiltonian.
Luckily, it turns out that the resource requirements for the simulation only depend on high-level attributes of
the Hamiltonian, specifically the number of orbitals and the number of CDF fragments it was factorized into, rather
than on the values of the one- and two-electron integrals themselves. This makes our job considerably simpler! It means
that we can bypass the tedious construction of the exact Hamiltonian, and instead use those two high-level attributes to
define a specialized
`compact Hamiltonian <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.estimator.compact_hamiltonian.CDFHamiltonian.html>`__
representation offered by PennyLane. Creating and using the compact Hamiltonian is much simpler, and it still
provides the high accuracy we need for our resource estimation. In this case, we adopt the commonly used rule of thumb that
the number of fragments needed for a high-fidelity CDF factorization is roughly equal to the number of spatial orbitals
in the Hamiltonian.

# formula <https://pennylane.ai/codebook/hamiltonian-simulation/trotterization>`_.
# The total simulation time is determined by the desired spectral resolution, while the time step :math:`\Delta t`

# XAS Circuit Construction
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# Having established the Hamiltonian structure and the Trotter step count, we are now
# ready to estimate resources for the complete algorithm.
#
# We assemble the complete XAS workflow as shown in the Hadamard test circuit, by
# combining state preparation, the Hadamard test structure, and controlled time evolution.
#
# For the initial state preparation, we adopt the **Sum of Slaters** method [#SOSStatePrep2024]_, which
# prepares in the quantum register an approximation to the ground state wavefunction, obtained by
# discarding Slater determinants below a coefficient tolerance.
# For this demo, we assume a truncation level that yields :math:`1 \times 10^4` surviving determinants (``num_slaters=1e4``).
# The cost of this approach depends on two major subroutines: :class:`~.pennylane.estimator.templates.QROM` to load the determinants,
# and :class:`~.pennylane.estimator.templates.QROMStatePreparation` to prepare the
# superposition.

# Estimating the Resources
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# With the circuit fully defined, we turn to resource estimation. Before generating counts, however,
# we must select an implementation strategy for the rotation gates, as this choice heavily influences
# the final resource overhead.
#
# By default, PennyLane's :mod:`estimator <pennylane.estimator>` provides the resources
for rotation gate synthesis using Repeat-Until-Success circuits [#Alex2014]_,
# which decompose rotations into sequences of probabilistic T-gates. While effective for general circuits,
# the algorithm in Fomichev et al. (2025) [#Fomichev2025]_ used instead the `phase gradient method <https://pennylane.ai/compilation/phase-gradient/>`__ proposed
# by Craig Gidney [#Gidney2018]_.
#
# The phase gradient trick is algorithmically superior for this application because it allows
# us to implement rotations with deterministic cost using arithmetic, rather than relying on
# probabilistic synthesis sequences. This results in better scaling as the precision requirements increase.
# This method relies on a specific
# resource state (the phase gradient state) that encodes phase information in its amplitudes.
# A unique mathematical property of this state is that adding an integer $k$ to the register
# mathematically induces a phase rotation of angle :math:`\theta \propto k`.
# Therefore, the cost of a rotation becomes identical to the cost of a quantum adder.
#
# To adopt this more efficient strategy, we configure the estimator to use the phase gradient trick
# with the use of a :class:`pennylane.estimator.resource_config.ResourceConfig`.

#
# Photodynamic Therapy Applications
# ---------------------------------
# Having shown how to estimate resources for an XAS spectroscopic workflow, let's see how we can
# apply these tools to a different application: **Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)**.
# Here, we need to estimate the cumulative absorption for a strongly correlated photosensitizer molecule [#Zhou2025]_.
#
# This application requires a different algorithmic approach. In XAS, we simulated the system's time evolution
# using Trotterization to recover the full spectrum. In PDT, we will instead employ a spectral filtering approach
# to directly read out how much of the spectral internsity falls within a predetermined window (typically 700–850 nm).
#
# To do the filtering, we will use generalized quantum signal processing (GQSP), combining it with a qubitization-based
# time evolution implementation. Specifically, we will use a walk operator constructed from the tensor hypercontracted
# Hamiltonian, which allows for a highly compact block encoding. As with XAS, we can use the
# `compact Hamiltonian <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.estimator.compact_hamiltonian.THCHamiltonian.html>`__
# representation to skip the expensive Hamiltonian construction. As an example, let's use the 11-orbital BODIPY system studied
# in Zhou et al. (2025) [#Zhou2025]_.

# Conclusion
# ----------
# In this demo, we showed how to perform end-to-end resource estimation for two distinct spectroscopic paradigms:
# the time-domain simulation of X-ray absorption (XAS) and the spectral filtering approach for photodynamic therapy (PDT).
#
# While PennyLane's resource :mod:`estimator <pennylane.estimator>` was able to give us initial estimates with
# minimum input information---including with only a high-level description of the Hamiltonian!---we also showed how
# versatile it can be. Moving beyond the standard implementations, we were able to quickly and easily implement
# algorithmic optimizations from the literature, namely the phase gradient trick and a specialized basis rotation implementation,
# and immediately see their impact on the resource counts.
#
# This capability to get rough, black-box estimates quickly, combined with being able to easily refine and improve them,
# is a fundamental design principle behind resource estimation in PennyLane, where our goal is to enable a broad range
# of researchers to design highly performant algorithmic workflows for their chosen quantum applications.

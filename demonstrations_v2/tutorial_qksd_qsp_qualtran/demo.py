r"""Using PennyLane and Qualtran to analyze how QSP can improve measurements of molecular properties
====================================================================================================

Want to efficiently measure molecular properties using quantum computers? In this demo, we
outline a powerful workflow for measuring molecular properties on future 
fault-tolerant quantum computers. We demonstrate how to construct the
Quantum Krylov Subspace Diagonalization (QKSD) ground state of the 
water molecule, represented as a sum of Chebyshev polynomials, using a QSP circuit in PennyLane.
This direct state preparation approach is highly efficient, enabling the measurement of 
properties like reduced density matrices with a constant number of circuit executions and 
thereby avoiding the quadratic scaling costs of other methods.
We then use the integration between PennyLane and Qualtran to perform a detailed resource analysis.

In this demo we will demonstrate some of the techniques and results of the paper titled
`Molecular Properties from Quantum Krylov Subspace Diagonalization <https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05286>`_
[#Oumarou]_. Specifically, we will:

* Introduce QKSD briefly.
* Build a circuit that uses QSP to prepare the QKSD ground-state.
* Simulate circuits that estimate the one-particle and two-particle reduced density matrices of a molecular system from the QKSD ground-state.
* Use the PennyLane-Qualtran integration to count relevant circuit resources and demonstrate linear resource scaling with respect to the Krylov dimension, :math:`D`.

# Quantum Krylov Subspace Diagonalization
# ---------------------------------------
#
# QKSD is a notable candidate algorithm for fault-tolerant quantum computing that approximates the
# low-lying eigenvalues and eigenstates of a large Hamiltonian by focusing on a smaller subspace of the same
# Hamiltonian [#QKSD]_. The general steps to perform QKSD are:
#
# * Obtain the Hamiltonian, :math:`\hat{H}`, describing a system of interest, e.g., a molecule.
# * Define a `Krylov subspace <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krylov_subspace>`_ :math:`\mathcal{K}`
#   defined by the span of quantum states :math:`| \psi_{k = 0, \dots, D-1} \rangle`, where :math:`D` is the Krylov 
#   dimension and :math:`| \psi_k \rangle` can be efficiently prepared on a quantum computer.
# * Project :math:`\hat{H}` into the Krylov subspace with a quantum computer, resulting in a new,
#   "smaller" Hamiltonian :math:`\tilde{H}` whose eigenvalues and eigenstates approximate those of
#   :math:`\hat{H}`.
# * Calculate the overlap matrix, :math:`\tilde{S}`, defined by the inner-products of each element
#   of the Krylov subspace.
# * Solve the generalized eigenvalue problem:
#   :math:`\tilde{H}c^m = E_m \tilde{S}c^m` on a classical computer.
#
# The result of this generalized eigenvalue problem gives approximations of the low-lying
# eigenenergies and eigenstates of the Hamiltonian [#QKSD]_, including the Krylov ground-state,
# :math:`|\Psi_0\rangle = \sum_k c^0_k | \psi_k \rangle`.
# Such an eigenstate is a linear combination of the states spanning the Krylov subspace and can
# be prepared with `QSP <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/function_fitting_qsp>`_.
#
# Let's now apply the above formalism to a familiar example: the :math:`H_2O` molecule.
# We will use the Jordan-Wigner mapping of the
# :math:`H_2O` Hamiltonian with an active space of 4 electrons in 4
# molecular orbitals in the cc-pVDZ basis. To save time on this computationally-expensive basis, we
# provide pre-calculated coefficients and Pauli words for this Hamiltonian below. It is also possible
# to obtain these values for other molecules and basis sets using either
# `PennyLane Datasets <https://pennylane.ai/datasets/h2o-molecule>`_ or the :mod:`pennylane.qchem`
# module. We use the pre-calculated results below to create a :class:`~pennylane.ops.Hamiltonian` object.

# Next, we will define the Krylov subspace, :math:`\mathcal{K}`.
# We first define the states that span :math:`\mathcal{K}`: 
#
# .. math:: \ket{\psi_k} = T_k(H)\ket{\psi_0},
#
# where :math:`T_k` is the :math:`k`-th Chebyshev polynomial and :math:`|\psi_0\rangle` is the
# Hartree-Fock state of the Hamiltonian. The Chebyshev polynomials are defined by:
#
# .. math:: T_0(\hat{H}) = \mathbb{1}
# .. math:: T_1(\hat{H}) = \hat{H}
# .. math:: T_{n+1}(\hat{H}) = 2 \hat{H} T_n(\hat{H}) - T_{n-1}(\hat{H})
#
# Other subspace definitions are possible [#QKSD]_, but we choose
# `Chebyshev polynomials <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials>`_
# for convenience. The reason for this is that we plan to
# prepare the Krylov ground-state using QSP, which directly implements Chebyshev polynomials.
# Other types of functions or polynomials would first need to be converted into
# Chebyshev polynomials, adding more complexity to our program.
# 
# With the states defined, the Krylov subspace of dimension :math:`D` is then: 
#
# .. math:: \mathcal{K} = \text{span}(\{\ket{\psi_k}\}_{k=0}^{D-1}).
#
# After projecting :math:`\hat{H}` into :math:`\mathcal{K}` and solving the generalized eigenvalue
# problem described above, we obtain the Krylov ground-state [#QKSD]_,
# 
# .. math:: \ket{\Psi_0} = \sum_{k=0}^{D-1} c^0_k \ket{\psi_k} = \sum_{k=0}^{D-1} c_k^0 T_k(H) \ket{\psi_0},
#
# where :math:`c_k^m` are the coefficients of the :math:`k`-th Chebyshev polynomial for the
# :math:`m`-th eigenvalue. We pre-calculate the these coefficients and use them to obtain the
# QSP rotation angles that prepare the QKSD ground-state in the section below.
#
# Using QSP to directly create the QKSD ground-state
# --------------------------------------------------
#
# Only using QKSD to calculate one-particle and two-particle reduced density matrices
# results in a quadratic scaling of the number of expectation
# values that need to be measured with respect to the Krylov dimension, :math:`D` [#Oumarou]_.
# Instead, reference [#Oumarou]_ shows that it is possible to reduce this to constant scaling by preparing
# :math:`|\Psi_0\rangle` via QSP and measuring individual terms of the Hamiltonian.
# The QSP circuit we will use, :math:`U_\text{QSP}`, is defined as a series of alternating
# block-encoding, :math:`U_\text{BE}`, and rotation operators, :math:`S`, such that
# [#qspref]_ [#Oumarou]_ :
# 
# .. math:: U_\text{QSP} = S(\phi_0)\prod_k^{d-1}{U_\text{BE}(\hat{H})S(\phi_k)}.
# 
# This QSP circuit prepares a Chebyshev polynomial of the block-encoded Hamiltonian:
#
# .. math:: U_\text{QSP} \ket{\psi_0} \ket{0}_a = \sum_{i=0}^{D-1} c_i T_i(H) \ket{\psi_0} \ket{0}_a + \beta\ket{\perp}.
#
# Choosing the right rotation angles, :math:`\phi`, causes :math:`U_\text{QSP}` to implement the 
# Chebyshev polynomial corresponding to the Krylov ground-state:
#
# .. math:: U_\text{QSP}|\psi_0\rangle|0\rangle = \ket{\Psi_0}\ket{0}_a + \beta\ket{\perp}
#
# For more details about implementing polynomials of block-encoded Hamiltonians, block-encoding
# operators, and rotation operators, see the
# `Intro to QSVT demo <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_intro_qsvt>`_.
#
#
# Measuring the reduced density matrices
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The elements of the one-particle reduced density matrix, :math:`\gamma_{pq}`, are obtained by
# measuring the expectation value of the fermionic one-particle excitation operators acting on
# the Krylov ground-state [#Oumarou]_. That is,
#
# .. math:: \gamma_{pq} = \langle\Psi_0 | a^{\dagger}_p a_q | \Psi_0\rangle.
#
# We can obtain these expectation values by measuring the right observables and post-processing
# the result according to reference [#Oumarou]_. Specifically, we use the Jordan-Wigner mapping of
# the fermionic one-particle excitation operators and measure the resulting Pauli word observables.
# By measuring each Pauli word, :math:`P` and a product of the Pauli word and a reflection around 0,
# :math:`R_0P`, we obtain:  
#
# .. math:: o_1 = \bra{\psi_0}\bra{0}_aU_\text{QSP}^{*}P U_\text{QSP}\ket{0}_a\ket{\psi_0}
# 
# .. math:: o_2 = \bra{\psi_0}\bra{0}_aU_\text{QSP}^{*}R_0 PU_\text{QSP}\ket{0}_a\ket{\psi_0}
#
# These measurements can then be combined according to [#Oumarou]_:
#
# .. math:: \langle \Psi_0 |P|\Psi_0\rangle = \eta^2(o_1 + o_2)/2,
#
# giving the value of :math:`\gamma_{pq}` for the Hamiltonian in the Jordan-Wigner mapping.
#
# Now let's see how to build the QSP circuit and measurements in PennyLane.
#
# Defining the QSP circuit
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# To define the QSP circuit, we first create a function to implement the rotations, :math:`S`. The
# block-encoding, :math:`U_\text{BE}`, will be implemented via the :class:`~pennylane.PrepSelPrep`
# class. We then create a QSP template to alternate between :math:`U_\text{BE}` and :math:`S`.
# Alternating between these operations
# will prepare a Chebyshev polynomial of the input block-encoded matrix.

# Analyzing with Qualtran
# -----------------------
# 
# We can analyze the resources and flow of this program by using the Qualtran call graph.
# We first convert the PennyLane circuit to a Qualtran bloq using :func:`~pennylane.to_bloq` and
# then use the call graph to count the required gates:

    odd_real=odd_real, odd_imag=odd_imag,

# We can then use Qualtran tools to analyze and process the gate counts of the circuit. Below,
# we use the ``call_graph`` to obtain a breakdown of the gates used, applying the
# ``generalize_rotation_angle`` generalizer to neatly group all rotations for clearer viewing:

######################################################################
# As explained in [#Oumarou]_,
# increasing :math:`D` improves the accuracy of the Krylov minimal energy
# compared to the true ground state energy. This extra accuracy is paid for by requiring additional gates.
# Let's see how the number of gates increases with increasing Krylov subspace dimension. We can
# increase the Krylov subspace dimension by increasing the number of terms in our Chebyshev polynomial,
# captured in this demo via the angles variables. Let's try :math:`D=20`
# by setting the number of terms in these angles to 20. As the resource estimation is independent of
# the exact angle values, we are able to set them randomly instead of recomputing the formally:

even_real = even_imag = odd_real = odd_imag = np.random.random(20)

######################################################################
# We then repeat the gate counts and see they have increased:

# We can plot how the number of gates increases with the Krylov dimension to see if it is linear
# as described in [#Oumarou]_. Below we plot how the ``Toffoli``, ``CNOT``, and ``X`` gate count increase with the Krylov dimension:

# Conclusion
# ----------
# This demo demonstrated how to
# use PennyLane to measure one-particle and two-particle reduced density matrices of the water molecule with a linearly-scaling
# number of operations and how to integrate with Qualtran to demonstrate these resource requirements.
# This is done by using Quantum Krylov Subspace Diagonalization (QKSD) techniques to compress a
# complicated molecular Hamiltonian, finding its ground-state classically, and then using Quantum Signal
# Processing (QSP) to efficiently measure its one-particle and two-particle reduced density matrices. 
#
# We then used the integration between PennyLane and Qualtran to perform a detailed resource analysis.
# By converting our PennyLane ``QNode`` into a Qualtran ``Bloq``, we precisely 
# counted the required quantum gates and confirmed that the number of gates scales linearly with the 
# Krylov subspace dimension, a crucial result from the source paper [#Oumarou]_. This favorable scaling 
# highlights the potential of QSP-based techniques for tackling meaningful quantum chemistry 
# problems and provides a practical framework for bridging the gap between theoretical algorithms 
# and their implementation on future quantum hardware.

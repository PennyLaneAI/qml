r"""Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes for quantum error correction
================================================================================

Quantum computers are envisioned to be incredibly powerful devices. While many of the
machines available today boast hundreds of qubits, their performance remains limited
by noise, which manifests as computational errors and impacts their utility.
Thus, for a fault-tolerant quantum computer to exist and be capable of running
indefinitely with minimal permissible errors, we need quantum error correction (QEC).

For this purpose, QEC codes encode :math:`k` logical qubits into :math:`n` physical qubits.
To allow for fault-tolerant computation with these :math:`k` logical qubits, the QEC codes
must serve as both reliable memory and a substrate for logic. This motivates the need for
the following four properties:

1. A high encoding rate :math:`R = k / n`.
2. Local and low-weight parity checks (= measurements for error detection).
3. As many gates from the universal gate set as possible should be implementable transversally,
   i.e., applied independently to each physical qubit without coupling qubits within the same
   code block.
4. Linear time classical decoding and corresponding error correction.

Unfortunately, these requirements are not all mutually compatible. For example, widely used
topological codes, such as :doc:`surface codes <demos/intro_to_surface_code>`, use local, nearest-neighbour connections, but usually
have poor encoding rates. It remains unclear which combination of these trade-offs will offer
the best long-term solution. However, because solving real-world problems requires scaling up to
thousands of logical qubits, moving beyond strict nearest-neighbour constraints has become crucial.

Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes are particularly well-suited for this purpose,
as they leverage high connectivity between qubits to drastically reduce qubit overheads, making
them the codes of choice for the hardware platforms that support such qubit connectivity.
As their name implies, they enforce a low-degree constraint, meaning each physical qubit
participates in only a few parity checks, and each check measures only a few qubits.
While this constraint is less essential for platforms with reconfigurable all-to-all connectivity,
their highly efficient decoding remains a major asset. In this demo, we will cover the basics
of qLDPC codes, including their construction and decoding. For readers unfamiliar with the
fundamentals of QEC, we recommend reading our tutorials on the
:doc:`Surface Code <demos/tutorial_game_of_surface_codes>`,
:doc:`Stabilizer Codes <demos/tutorial_stabilizer_codes>`, and
:doc:`Lattice Surgery <demos/tutorial_lattice_surgery>` that cover them in detail.

Classical LDPC Codes
--------------------

To understand quantum LDPC codes, we begin by looking at their classical counterparts, which
have revolutionized modern telecommunications (powering Wi-Fi and 5G networks) by approaching
the absolute theoretical limits of data transmission, known as the `Shannon limit
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_limit>`_. Classical LDPC codes achieve this with highly
efficient, linear-time decoding that exploits the sparse structure of their parity checks.

A classical LDPC code :math:`C[n,k,d]` protects :math:`k` logical bits by encoding them into
:math:`n` physical bits. Here :math:`d` is the minimum distance of the code, which dictates the
number of errors the code can correct. The encoding rules are defined by an :math:`m\times n`
parity-check matrix (:math:`H`), where :math:`k = n - m` [#qldpc1]_, where :math:`m` is the
number of parity checks. The "low-density" part of their name comes from this matrix being
overwhelmingly sparse, i.e., filled mostly with zeros, and more specifically, the column/row
weights (number of 1s in each column/row) are strictly bounded constants independent of :math:`n`.
For a practical code, both must be bounded, because they carry distinct physical meaning: (i) a
low column weight limits how many parity checks each bit participates in, while (ii) a low row
weight limits how many bits each parity check involves, keeping decoding local and efficient.

Mathematically, these codes are visualized as `Tanner graphs
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_graph>`_, which are bipartite graphs with edges
representing connections between the variable nodes (:math:`n` physical bits)
and the check nodes (:math:`m` parity constraints). For example, the following
is a Tanner graph for a simple :math:`[5, 2, 3]` LDPC code:
"""

import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the parity-check matrix H
H = np.array([[1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]])

# Construct the Tanner Graph with variable nodes and check nodes.
G = nx.Graph()
num_checks, num_vars = H.shape
var_nodes = [f"v{i}" for i in range(num_vars)]
check_nodes = [f"c{j}" for j in range(num_checks)]
G.add_nodes_from(var_nodes, bipartite=0)
G.add_nodes_from(check_nodes, bipartite=1)
for (i, j) in zip(*np.nonzero(H)):
    G.add_edge(f"c{i}", f"v{j}")

# When noise corrupts our bits, it creates an error vector :math:`\vec{e}`, where a ``1``
# at position :math:`i` means bit :math:`i` was flipped. The system identifies this
# error by computing the syndrome :math:`s = H\vec{e} \pmod{2}`, which flags the
# parity checks that are violated. We can see this with an error on bit ``0``:
#

error_vec = np.array([1, 0, 0, 0, 0]) # bit flip on bit 0
syndrome = (H @ error_vec) % 2

# Here, checks ``0`` and ``2`` fire because bit ``0`` participates in exactly those two rows of
# :math:`H`, visible as edges in the Tanner graph above. Crucially, as each check node only connects
# to a handful of data nodes (and vice versa), these codes achieve linear-time decoding complexity.
# This efficiency is possible because errors can be decoded using local message-passing algorithms
# sharing probabilistic information along the edges of the Tanner graph until all parity constraints
# are satisfied. This will come in handy when we learn about decoding, but before that, let's first
# return to constructing qLDPC codes.
#
# Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) construction
# ------------------------------------------
#
# The key goal of qLDPC codes is to replicate this sparsity (and unlock linear-time decoding) in
# the quantum realm, but this is a non-trivial task. Due to quantum no-go theorems, we cannot
# directly read the state to perform standard parity checks. Furthermore, qubits suffer from phase
# flips alongside standard bit flips—an error type with no classical analog. Therefore, to detect
# errors, we must rely on measuring commuting multi-qubit Pauli operators that can identify both
# types of flips.
#
# The most elegant and widely used solution to build a series of such operators is the
# Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code construction [#CSS]_. CSS codes belong to the broader class of
# stabilizer codes, where the codespace is defined as the ``+1`` eigenspace of a set of commuting
# multi-qubit Pauli operators called *stabilizers*. A CSS code introduces these stabilizers as two
# separate sets of parity checks: one containing only Pauli-Z operators to catch bit flips, and
# another containing only Pauli-X operators to catch phase flips.
#
# For a CSS code on :math:`n` qubits with :math:`m_1` X-checks and :math:`m_2` Z-checks, each
# set is naturally represented as a classical parity-check matrix, :math:`H_X` and :math:`H_Z`
# respectively. Each defines a bipartite Tanner graph where check nodes connect to the qubit
# nodes they act on. Since both graphs share the same :math:`n` qubit nodes, they can be combined
# into a single unified hypergraph. This hypergraph is captured by its incidence matrix, where
# :math:`H^{ij}_P = 1` for :math:`P \in \{X, Z\}`, if the :math:`i^{th}` :math:`P`-type
# check has support on the :math:`j^{th}` qubit, and :math:`0` otherwise. Both incidence
# matrices pack naturally into a single :math:`(m_1 + m_2) \times 2n` block matrix
# :math:`H = [0, H_Z;\, H_X, 0]` in the symplectic form, where each row directly
# corresponds to one stabilizer generator. As an example, consider the following
# CSS code known as the `Steane code <https://errorcorrectionzoo.org/c/steane>`_
# :math:`[[7,1,3]]`, constructed from the two :math:`m=3` Hamming codes:
#

def hamming_code(rank: int) -> np.ndarray:
    """Returns a Hamming code parity check matrix of a given rank."""
    bit_masks = np.arange(1, 2**rank)[:, None] & (1 << np.arange(rank)[::-1])
    return (bit_masks > 0).astype(np.uint8).T

h1, h2 = hamming_code(3), hamming_code(3)

css_code = np.hstack((
        np.vstack([np.zeros((m1, n1), dtype=np.uint8), h1]),
        np.vstack([h2, np.zeros((m2, n2), dtype=np.uint8)])
))

print(f"Shape of the CSS code: {css_code.shape}")

######################################################################
# For these codes, all stabilizers must commute, which is ensured by having each of the
# :math:`X - Z` stabilizer pairs overlap on an even number of qubits. Mathematically, this is
# equivalent to the symplectic orthogonality condition :math:`H_X(H_Z)^T = 0 \pmod{2}`,
# which can easily be verified like so:
#

hx, hz = css_code[m1:, :n1], css_code[:m1, n1:] # Extract individual components.

# by computing the code dimension (:math:`k`), obtained by subtracting the linearly independent

# Hypergraph Product Codes
# ------------------------
#
# Finding a single sparse matrix for a classical code is straightforward. However,
# for a quantum CSS code, we additionally need two sparse matrices that also commute
# with each other. While this is still doable, coming up with the matrices that
# simultaneously yield a constant encoding rate :math:`k = \Theta(n)` and a growing
# distance :math:`d = \Theta(n^\alpha)` for some :math:`0 < \alpha \leq 1`, where
# :math:`n` is the number of physical qubits, is notoriously difficult. This severely
# limits the design space compared to classical codes, which is why it took decades
# for researchers to discover families of good qLDPC codes. A foundational step in
# this direction was the Hypergraph Product (HGP) construction [#HGP]_, which takes
# two classical LDPC codes, :math:`C_1` (:math:`[n_1, k_1, d_1]`)
# and :math:`C_2` (:math:`[n_2, k_2, d_2]`), with parity-check matrices :math:`H_1`
# (:math:`m_1 \times n_1`) and :math:`H_2` (:math:`m_2 \times n_2`), respectively,
# and produces a CSS code with the following parity-check matrices:
#
# .. math::
#
#     H_X = (H_1 \otimes I_{n_2} | I_{m_1} \otimes H_2^T),\\
#     H_Z = (I_{n_1} \otimes H_2 | H_1^T \otimes I_{m_2}).
#
# Here, the algebraic properties of the tensor product ensure that :math:`H_X` and :math:`H_Z`
# satisfy the symplectic orthogonality condition. Furthermore, the transposed matrix :math:`H_i^T`
# defines the transpose code, which has its own parameters :math:`[m_i, k_i^t, d_i^t]`, where
# the superscript :math:`t` simply labels the dimension and distance of this new code.
# For example, look at the following HGP code constructed from two :math:`d_1=3` and :math:`d_2=3`
# repetition codes, which is equivalent to a toric code :math:`[[13, 1, 3]]`:

# physical qubits with distance :math:`d=\min(d_1,d_2,d_1^t,d_2^t)`. This means that
# the HGP codes achieve a constant encoding rate :math:`R=\Theta(1)`, but their distance
# grows only as :math:`d=\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})`, matching the surface code scaling.
# Note that the distance computed here is technically a classical distance, calculated
# as the minimum of the classical distances of the seed codes and their transposes.
# In general quantum code constructions, such a classical distance serves only as an
# upper bound for the true quantum distance, which is inherently complex to compute as
# it requires finding the minimum weight of an error that goes undetected by the checks
# but is not a stabilizer. However, for HGP codes specifically, it has been rigorously
# proven that this computed classical distance is exactly equal to the true quantum
# distance [#HGP]_. This exact equivalence is a special feature of HGP codes; for other
# code families, the two can diverge significantly, and numerical estimation is needed
# to find the true value.
#
# Modern qLDPC Codes
# -------------------
#
# To build truly scalable quantum computation devices, we need to at least achieve a linear
# distance scaling, i.e., :math:`d=\Theta(n)`. In recent years, there has been some progress
# towards this goal, primarily through a series of breakthroughs, some of which are:
#
# 1. **Lifted Product (LP) Codes:** To overcome the :math:`\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})` distance barrier
#    of standard HGP codes, LP codes replace the binary scalar entries of a classical seed matrix
#    with elements of a cyclic group algebra, i.e., polynomials in :math:`\mathbb{F}_2[x]/(x^N-1)`,
#    representing cyclic shifts [#LPCodes]_. By taking the hypergraph product over this polynomial
#    space and *lifting* the result back into a sparse binary matrix, they inject powerful
#    algebraic constraints. This first boosted the minimum distance to :math:`d=\Theta(n/\log n)`,
#    and was later improved to fully linear :math:`d = \Theta(n)`, while maintaining a constant
#    encoding rate :math:`R = \Theta(1)`.
#
# 2. **Quantum Tanner (QT) Codes:** Seeking to maximize both storage density and error-correcting
#    power, these codes are constructed by placing qubits on the squares of a left-right Cayley
#    complex, i.e., a 2D structure built from two Cayley graphs of a finite group with high
#    spectral expansion [#QTCodes]_. By enforcing local classical Tanner code constraints at every
#    vertex of this complex, the expander geometry prevents small errors from forming undetectable
#    logical operators. This achieves constant encoding rate with strictly linear distance
#    :math:`d = \Theta(n)`, meeting the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound.
#
# 3. **Bivariate Bicycle (BB) Codes:** These codes bridge the gap between the abstract algebra of
#    expander graphs that require highly non-local hardware wiring, and the physical reality of
#    quantum processors [#BBCodes]_. They are built using pairs of low-degree polynomials :math:`A(x,y)`
#    and :math:`B(x,y)` over the ring :math:`\mathbb{F}_2[x,y]/(x^\ell - 1, y^m - 1)`, where
#    :math:`x` and :math:`y` generate cyclic shifts along the two axes of an :math:`\ell \times m`
#    torus. This ensures that physical qubits can be laid out in a quasi-2D architecture with
#    strictly bounded, short-range connections, making them highly viable for current hardware.
#
# To see why these modern constructions are so powerful, let us look at a simplified construction
# of the QT codes. The function ``tanner_code`` below takes the base parity-check matrices of
# an HGP code and iteratively applies a row-and-column elimination procedure to enforce the
# local-code structure of the Tanner graph, which removes the inter-block redundancies in the
# HGP parity-checks.

# Decoding qLDPC Codes
# ----------------------
#
# As mentioned earlier, Tanner graphs constructed using the parity-check matrix of the code
# can be used for decoding errors efficiently using an iterative message-passing algorithm
# like :doc:`Belief Propagation (BP) <demos/tutorial_bp_catalyst>` [#BProp]_.
# This decoding process can be thought of as a collaborative exercise, where the variable nodes
# (qubits) and check nodes (parity rules) act like detectives passing *messages* back and forth.
# A variable node sends a confidence level message, *"I am 84% sure that I have an error"*. The
# check node looks at the notes from all connected qubits, applies the parity rule, and replies
# *"Based on the group's evidence, adjust your confidence to 96%"*. Mathematically, these messages
# are Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs), which are updated iteratively until all parity rules are
# satisfied (consensus) or a fixed number of iterations is reached, making the whole process
# executable in polynomial time.
#
# For classical codes, BP is near-optimal and runs in :math:`\mathcal{O}(\log n)` iterations.
# However, quantum codes suffer from degeneracy, where multiple different error patterns trigger
# the exact same syndrome. This leads to ambiguity in the BP decoder, causing it to endlessly
# flip-flop without reaching a consensus. When BP fails to converge, we use Ordered Statistics
# Decoding (OSD) with order-0 as a fallback [#OSD0]_. One can think of OSD-0 as a tie-breaker,
# which takes the final, unresolved LLRs from BP and ranks the qubits from most to least confident.
# It locks in the most confident qubits as absolute truth, and then uses Gaussian elimination to
# mathematically force a valid parity solution for the remaining uncertain qubits. Let us define
# a decoder class that implements this, where the BP is implemented using the ``tanh`` product rule
# and the OSD-0 uses :func:`~.pennylane.math.binary_finite_reduced_row_echelon` to perform
# `Gaussian elimination <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination>`_.

#
# Logical Gates for qLDPC Codes
# ------------------------------
#
# Beyond just storing information safely, a practical quantum computer must also perform logic
# operations on encoded qubits. This is done using logical operators, which are the specific
# combinations of physical single-qubit gates that act on the encoded logical qubits. The most
# fundamental of these are the logical Pauli operators. To be valid, a logical operator must
# commute with all of the code's stabilizers, ensuring it does not trigger an error syndrome.
# However, it must not be a member of the stabilizer group itself; instead, it must act
# nontrivially on the encoded logical state rather than as the identity.
#
# For general CSS codes, including qLDPC code families, we can systematically construct a
# canonical basis of :math:`k` logical operator pairs :math:`\{(L_X^{(i)}, L_Z^{(i)})\}_{i=1}^{k}`
# using linear algebra over :math:`\mathbb{F}_2`. The algorithm requires two sequential passes
# of `Gaussian elimination <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination>`_, first on
# :math:`H_X`, then on the remaining free columns of :math:`H_Z`, to identify the logical
# sector. By doing this, we natively guarantee the canonical anticommutation condition
# :math:`L_X^{(i)} \cdot L_Z^{(j)} = \delta_{ij} \pmod{2}`, where :math:`\delta_{ij}` is the
# Kronecker delta. For example, below we construct logical operators for a simple toric code.

# Transversal Gates for qLDPC Codes
# ----------------------------------
#
# Transversal gates are logical operations realized by applying gates independently
# to corresponding qubits across code blocks, with no interactions within a single
# code block. For a single logical qubit, this means independent single-qubit gates
# applied in parallel across all physical qubits. Because each physical qubit
# is acted on by at most one gate, errors cannot spread within the block, making them
# inherently fault-tolerant. For example, a transversal :math:`T^\dagger` gate in the
# :math:`[[15, 1, 3]]` quantum `Reed-Muller code <https://errorcorrectionzoo.org/c/stab_15_1_3>`_
# corresponds to applying the :class:`~.pennylane.T` gate on all physical qubits, i.e.,
# :math:`T^\dagger_L = T^{\otimes 15}`.
#
# However, the `Eastin-Knill theorem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastin%E2%80%93Knill_theorem>`_
# restricts the set of logical unitary product operators that can be applied transversally for
# any nontrivial local-error-detecting quantum code to be non-universal. For most stabilizer codes,
# the transversal gate set is limited to the Clifford group. The non-Clifford gates such as
# :class:`~.pennylane.T` must instead be realized indirectly, for example via `magic state injection
# <https://pennylane.ai/glossary/what-are-magic-states>`__ [#Transversal]_.
#
# A notable property of certain qLDPC code families is their native support for transversal
# non-Clifford gates, such as the :class:`~.pennylane.CCZ` gate. While this property
# depends on the specific algebraic structure of the code rather than being a consequence of the
# low-density parity check construction alone, it substantially reduces the hardware overhead
# needed for universal quantum computing. We can test if any given operation is transversal
# for a given code by testing if (i) it preserves its *codespace*, i.e., the subspace
# stabilized by all stabilizer generators, and (ii) maps logical operators to valid
# logical operators. For example, we can check whether the :class:`~.pennylane.SWAP` gate is
# transversal for the previously constructed toric code by first verifying condition (i).

# In addition to the gate operations being transversal, there's active work being done to develop
# efficient frameworks to perform logical Pauli measurements [#LMHM]_, which is another
# critical requirement for the practical utility of these codes.
#
# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# The journey to fault-tolerant quantum computing hinges on managing errors without requiring an
# astronomical number of physical qubits. By relaxing the strict nearest-neighbor constraints of
# topological codes, quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes offer a profound paradigm
# shift: they trade massive qubit overheads for more complex hardware connectivity. While this
# adds challenges in superconducting qubit platforms, it is a natural fit for photonic platforms.
# In this demo, we explored the fundamentals of these codes, including their construction,
# decoding mechanisms, and key properties like their transversal gate sets.
#
# While recent breakthroughs in qLDPC codes, such as lifted product and quantum Tanner codes,
# have achieved linear distance scaling, their physical construction remains quite involved in
# practice. Furthermore, other promising candidates for
# low-overhead quantum memory, like bivariate bicycle codes, still exhibit asymptotic badness,
# as their distance scales sub-linearly as the number of physical qubits increases. Beyond these
# structural challenges, more work is needed to design transversal gates that allow for complex
# logical operations. We also need to improve general-purpose BP-OSD decoders so they can better
# exploit the specific structure of the code for real-time error correction.
#
# Fortunately, advancements in dynamically reconfigurable and modular architectures are beginning
# to turn these highly connected codes into a physical reality. While many engineering hurdles
# remain, particularly in designing universal transversal gate sets and executing efficient logical
# measurements, things look promising. Supported by fast, linear-time decoding algorithms and
# increasingly flexible hardware, qLDPC codes have evolved past elegant mathematical formalism.
# They are rapidly progressing toward practicality, offering a compelling, high-performance
# alternative to traditional surface or toric codes.

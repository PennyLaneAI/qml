r"""Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes for quantum error correction
================================================================================

Quantum computers are envisioned to be incredibly powerful computational devices. While many of the
machines available today boast hundreds of qubits, their performance remains limited due to noise
present in these systems, which manifests itself as computational errors and impacts their utility.
Thus, for a fault-tolerant quantum computer to exist, where one can run these devices indefinitely
with minimal permissible errors, we need quantum error correction (QEC).

For this purpose, QEC codes encode :math:`n` physical qubits into :math:`k` logical qubits.
To allow for fault-tolerant computation with these :math:`k` qubits, the QEC codes need to have
the following desirable properties:

1. A high encoding rate (:math:`R = k / n`).
2. Local and low-weight parity checks, i.e., measurements for error detection.
3. An over-complete universal gate set with as many gates that can be applied transversally,
   i.e., without entangling different physical systems within the code, as possible.
4. Linear time classical decoding and corresponding error correction.

Unfortunately, these requirements are not all mutually compatible. For example, widely used
topological codes such as surface codes use local, nearest-neighbour connections, but have an
inefficient encoding rate, i.e., protecting one logical qubit (:math:`k=1`) requires a patch of
thousands of physical qubits (:math:`n \gg k`).

However, it remains unclear which combination of these options would lead to the best long-term
solution. But as solving real-world problems requires scaling up to thousands of logical qubits,
moving beyond strict nearest-neighbor constraints becomes crucial. Quantum low-density parity-check
(QLDPC) codes are particularly well-suited for this, as they can leverage high-connectivity between
qubits to drastically reduce qubit overheads, making them preferred codes of choice for the
photonic and neutral-atom platforms that offer such qubit connectivity. In this demo, we will cover
the basics of QLDPC codes, including their construction and decoding. For the readers who are not
familiar with the fundamentals of QEC, we recommend reading our tutorials on the :doc:`Surface Code
<demos/tutorial_game_of_surface_codes>`, :doc:`Stabilizer Codes <demos/tutorial_stabilizer_codes>`,
and :doc:`Lattice Surgery <demos/tutorial_lattice_surgery>` that cover them in detail.

Classical LDPC Codes
--------------------

To understand quantum LDPC codes, we begin by looking at their classical counterparts, which
have revolutionized modern telecommunications (powering Wi-Fi and 5G networks) by approaching
the absolute theoretical limits of data transmission, known as the `Shannon limit
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_limit>`_. Classical LDPC codes achieve this with highly
efficient, linear-time decoding that exploits the sparse structure of their parity checks.

A classical LDPC code :math:`C[n,k,d]` protects :math:`k` logical bits by encoding them into
:math:`n` physical bits, where :math:`d` is the minimum distance of the code that dictates how
many errors the code can correct. The encoding rules are defined by an :math:`m\times n`
parity-check matrix (:math:`H`), where :math:`k = n - m` [#qldpc1]_. The "low-density" part of
their name comes from this matrix being overwhelmingly sparse, i.e., filled mostly with zeros,
and more specifically, the column/row weights (number of 1s in each column/row) are strictly
bounded constants independent of :math:`n`.

Mathematically, these codes are visualized as `Tanner graphs
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_graph>`_, which are bipartite graphs with edges
representing connections between the variable nodes (:math:`n` physical bits)
and the check nodes (:math:`m` parity constraints). For example, the following
is a Tanner graph for a simple :math:`[5, 2, 3]` LDPC code:
"""

import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the parity-check matrix H
H = np.array([[1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]])

# Construct the Tanner Graph with variable nodes and check nodes.
G = nx.Graph()
num_checks, num_vars = H.shape
var_nodes = [f"v{i}" for i in range(num_vars)]
check_nodes = [f"c{j}" for j in range(num_checks)]
G.add_nodes_from(var_nodes, bipartite=0)
G.add_nodes_from(check_nodes, bipartite=1)

for j in range(num_checks):
    for i in range(num_vars):
        if H[j, i] == 1:
            G.add_edge(f"c{j}", f"v{i}")

# Plot the Bipartite Graph
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
pos = nx.bipartite_layout(G, var_nodes)
colors = ["#70CEFF"] * num_vars + ["#C756B2"] * num_checks
nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_color=colors, node_size=500)
text_options = {"verticalalignment": "center", "fontsize": 12}
plt.text(-0.75, 0.0, "Variable Nodes", rotation=90, color=colors[0], **text_options)
plt.text(1.1, 0.0, "Check Nodes", rotation=270, color=colors[-1], **text_options)

#
# When noise corrupts our bits, creating an error vector :math:`\vec{e}`, the system identifies the
# problem by computing the syndrome :math:`s = H\vec{e} \mod\ 2`. As each check node only connects
# to a handful of data nodes (and vice versa), these codes achieve linear-time decoding complexity
# because errors can be decoded using local message-passing algorithms sharing probabilistic
# information along the edges of the Tanner graph until all parity constraints are satisfied.
# This will come in handy when we learn about decoding, but before that, let's return to first
# constructing QLDPC codes.
#
# Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) construction
# ------------------------------------------
#
# The key goal of QLDPC codes is to replicate this sparsity (and unlock linear-time decoding) in the
# quantum realm. However, this is a non-trivial task. Due to quantum no-go theorems, we cannot
# directly read the state to perform standard parity checks. Furthermore, qubits suffer from phase
# flips alongside standard bit flips—an error type with no classical analog. Therefore, to detect
# errors, we must rely on measuring commuting multi-qubit Pauli operators that can identify both
# types of flips.
#
# The most elegant and widely used solution to build a series of such operators is the
# Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code construction [#CSS]_. A CSS code introduces two separate
# sets of parity checks: one containing only Pauli-Z operators to catch bit flips, and another
# containing only Pauli-X operators to catch phase flips. We can represent these sets using two
# classical parity-check matrices, :math:`H_Z` and :math:`H_X`, which act as distinct Tanner graphs.
# These graphs are then combined into a single hypergraph, where the elements are defined
# as :math:`H_{ij}^{P=\{X,Z\}} = 1` only if the :math:`i^{th}` :math:`P`-type check has support
# on the :math:`j^{th}` qubit.
#
# For example, look at the following CSS code known as the `Steane code
# <https://errorcorrectionzoo.org/c/steane>`_ :math:`[[7,1,3]]`, which is constructed from the two
# :math:`d=3` Hamming codes. To build its corresponding parity-check matrix, we assign the Hamming
# code's parity-check matrix to both the :math:`X` and :math:`Z` checks, and stack them into a
# single block matrix :math:`H = [H_X, 0;\, 0, H_Z]`, which is shown below:
#

from pennylane.math import binary_matrix_rank

    return (bit_masks > 0).astype(np.uint8).T

))

######################################################################
# For these codes, all stabilizers must commute, which is ensured by having each of the
# :math:`X - Z` stabilizer pairs overlap on an even number of qubits. Mathematically, this is
# equivalent to the symplectic orthogonality condition :math:`H^X(H^Z)^T = 0\mod\ 2`,
# which we can be easily verified below:
#

hx, hz = css_code[m1:, :n1], css_code[:m2, n2:] # Extract individual components.
print(f"Does H_X * H_Z^T = 0? {np.allclose((hx @ hz.T) % 2, 0)}")
print(f"Does H_Z * H_X^T = 0? {np.allclose((hz @ hx.T) % 2, 0)}\n")

# by computing the code dimension (:math:`k`) by subtracting the linearly independent stabilizer
# constraints from the total number of physical qubits.

# Hypergraph Product Codes
# ------------------------

# Finding a single sparse matrix for a classical code is straightforward. However, for a
# quantum code, we must find two sparse matrices that also perfectly commute with each other.
# This requires their parity checks to always overlap on an even number of qubits, whcich is
# a strict mathematical constraint that makes generating these matrices notoriously difficult.
# This severely limits the design space compared to classical codes, which is why it took decades
# for researchers to discover families of good QLDPC codes. However, a foundational breakthrough
# happened with the Hypergraph Product (HGP) codes [#HGP]_, which takes two classical LDPC codes,
# :math:`C_1` (:math:`[n_1, k_1, d_1]`) and :math:`C_2` (:math:`[n_2, k_2, d_2]`),
# with parity-check matrices :math:`H_1` (:math:`m_1 \times n_1`) and
# :math:`H_2` (:math:`m_2 \times n_2`), respectively, and produces a CSS code with the following
# parity-check matrices:
#
# .. math::
#
#     H^X = (H_1 \otimes I_{n_2} | I_{m_1} \otimes H_2^T),\\
#     H^Z = (I_{n_1} \otimes H_2 | H_1^T \otimes I_{m_2}).
#
# Here the algebraic properties of the tensor product ensure that :math:`H^X` and :math:`H^Z`
# satisfy the symplectic orthogonality condition. Furthermore, the transposed matrix :math:`H_i^T`
# defines the transpose code, which has its own parameters :math:`[m_i, k_i^T, d_i^T]`, where the
# superscript :math:`T` simply labels the dimension and distance of this new code.
# For example, look at the following HGP code constructed from two :math:`d_1=3` and :math:`d_2=3`
# repetition codes, which is equivalent to a Toric code :math:`[[13, 1, 3]]`:

# the HGP codes achieve a constant encoding rate :math:`R=\Theta(1)`, but their distance
# grows only as :math:`d=\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})`, matching the surface code scaling. Note
# that, the distance computed here is the classical distance, which is not the same as
# the quantum distance. The latter is more complex to compute as it requires finding
# the minimum weight of an error that goes undetected by the checks but is
# not a stabilizer.
#
# Modern QLDPC Codes
# -------------------
#
# To build truly scalable quantum computation devices, we need to at least achieve a linear
# distance scaling, i.e., :math:`d=\Theta(n)`. In recent years, there has been some progress
# in achieving this goal, primarily through a series of breakthroughs, some of which are:
#
# 1. Lifted Product (LP) Codes: To overcome the :math:`O(\sqrt{n})` distance barrier of standard
#    HGP codes, these codes replace the binary scalar entries of a classical seed matrix with
#    elements of a group algebra, such as polynomials representing cyclic shifts [#LPCodes]_.
#    By taking the hypergraph product over this polynomial space and "lifting" the result back
#    into a massive, sparse binary matrix, this hidden group structure injects powerful
#    algebraic constraints. This drastically boosts the minimum distance to
#    :math:`d = \Theta(\sqrt{n} \log n)`, while maintaining a constant encoding rate
#    :math:`R = \Theta(1)` and the crucial sparsity required for fast message-passing decoding.
#
# 2. Quantum Tanner (QT) Codes: Seeking to maximize both storage density and error-correcting
#    power, these codes move away from flat grids and are constructed using Cayley graphs of
#    finite groups with high expansion properties [#QTCodes]_. By placing qubits on the faces of
#    a multidimensional square complex and rigidly enforcing local classical constraints at
#    every vertex, the expander graph geometry physically prevents small errors from forming
#    undetectable logical operators. Consequently, these codes achieve both a constant rate
#    :math:`R = \Theta(1)` and a strictly linear distance :math:`d = \Theta(n)`,
#    approaching the theoretical limit of the quantum Singleton bound, where doubling the
#    physical qubits strictly doubles the error-correcting power.
#
# 3. Bivariate Bicycle (BB) Codes: These codes were specifically developed to bridge the gap
#    between the abstract algebra of expander graphs, which require highly non-local hardware
#    wiring, and the reality of physical quantum processors [#BBCodes]_. They are built using
#    simple bivariate polynomials of two commuting variables (:math:`x` and :math:`y`) that
#    directly correspond to local spatial shifts on a periodic 2D grid, ensuring the resulting
#    parity-check matrices commute. By construction, the physical qubits can be laid
#    out in a quasi-2D architecture with strictly bounded, short-range connections,
#    while sacrificing infinite asymptotic linear scaling.
#
# Below, we take a look at a simplified QT codes construction and benchmark the
# improvements in the distance scaling compared to the HGP codes:

# Decoding QLDPC Codes
# ----------------------
#
# As mentioned earlier, Tanner graphs constructed using the parity-check matrix of the code
# can be used for decoding errors efficiently using an iterative message-passing algorithm
# like Belief Propagation (BP) [#BProp]_. This decoding process can be thought of as a
# collaborative excercise, where the variable nodes (qubits) and check nodes (parity rules) act
# like detectives passing notes back and forth. A variable node sends a confidence level message:
# "I am 84% sure I have an error." The check node looks at the notes from all connected qubits,
# applies the parity rule, and replies: "Based on group's evidence, adjust your confidence to 96%."
# Mathematically, these "notes" are Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs), which are updated iteratively
# until all parity rules are satisfied (consensus) or a fixed number of iterations is reached,
# making the whole process executable in polynomial time.
# polynomial time.
#
# For classical codes, BP is near-optimal and runs in :math:`O(\log n)` iterations. However,
# quantum codes suffer from degeneracy, where multiple different error patterns trigger the exact
# same syndrome. This often confuses BP, causing it to endlessly flip-flop without reaching a
# consensus. When BP fails to converge, we use Ordered Statistics Decoding (OSD) with order-0 as
# a fallback [#OSD0]_. One can think of OSD-0 as a tie-breaker, which takes the final,
# unresolved LLRs from BP and ranks the qubits from most to least confident. It locks in the
# "most confident" qubits as absolute truth, and then uses Gaussian elimination to mathematically
# force a valid parity solution for the remaining uncertain qubits. Let us define a decoder class
# that implements this, where the BP is implemented using the ``tanh`` product rule and the OSD-0
# uses :func:`~.pennylane.math.binary_finite_reduced_row_echelon` to perform Gaussian elimination.

# Transversal Gates for QLDPC Codes
# ----------------------------------
#
# Beyond just storing information safely, a practical quantum computer must also perform logic 
# operations on encoded qubits. A logical gate on a logical qubit is always realized by a
# collection of microscopic operations on the physical qubits. Transversal gates typically refer
# to the special case where the logical operation is realized by its equivalent physical operation
# on all qubits. For example, a transversal :math:`T` gate in the Steane code corresponds to
# applying a :class:`~.pennylane.T` gate on all physical qubits.
#
# As such, they are relatively easy to implement and propagate minimal errors. However, the
# `Earnest-Knill theorem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastin%E2%80%93Knill_theorem>`_ restricts
# the set of the logical unitary product operators that can be applied transversally for any
# nontrivial local-error-detecting quantum code to be non-universal. While this limits the ways
# to implement fault-tolerant gates on quantum codes, there are still ways to use non-transversal
# methods to implement a logical gate. For example, we can implement non-Clifford gates such as
# :class:`~.pennylane.T` by injecting a `magic state
# <https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/what-are-magic-states>`__ #Transversal]_.
#
# While the transversal gate set for most standard codes is limited to Clifford gates, a major
# breakthrough of certain QLDPC code families is their ability to natively support transversal
# non-Clifford gates, such as the :class:`~.pennylane.CCZ` gate. This drastically reduces the
# hardware overhead needed for universal quantum computing. We can test if a given operation is
# transversal for a given code by testing if it preserves its *codespace*. For example, we test
# if the :class:`~.pennylane.SWAP` gate is transversal for a simple Toric code.

# In addition to the gate operations being transversal, there's active work being done to develop
# efficient frameworks to perform logical Pauli measurements, as well [#LMHM]_, which is another
# critical requirement for the partical utility of these codes.
#
# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# The journey to fault-tolerant quantum computing hinges on managing errors without requiring an
# astronomical number of physical qubits. By relaxing the strict nearest-neighbor constraints of
# topological codes, Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (QLDPC) codes offer a profound paradigm
# shift: they trade massive qubit overhead for a complex hardware connectivity challenge.
#
# So, which codes are actually leading the charge? While early abstract constructions like purely
# random sparse matrices proved too difficult to wire or decode in practice, highly structured
# families have emerged as the clear path forward. For near-term hardware with limited but growing
# connectivity, Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes are currently the most promising candidates. Looking
# further ahead, asymptotically good codes such as lifted product and quantum Tanner codes offer
# the ultimate theoretical scaling for massive quantum processors.
#
# Advancements in dynamically reconfigurable and modular architectures are turning these highly
# connected codes into a physical reality. While still many engineering hurdles remain,
# particularly in designing universal transversal gate sets and executing efficient logical
# measurements. However, supported by fast, linear-time decoding algorithms, QLDPC codes have
# evolved past elegant mathematical formalism and are progressing towards practicality.

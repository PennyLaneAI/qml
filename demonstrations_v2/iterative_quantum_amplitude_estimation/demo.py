Iterative Quantum Amplitude Estimation
======================================

.. tip::
    Though some description is provided here, it may be useful to brush up on :doc:`amplitude amplification <demos/tutorial_intro_amplitude_amplification>` and :doc:`quantum phase estimation <demos/tutorial_qpe>` if needed. Then come right back!

It is expensive to guess. 

If, for example, you want to find a specific element in a list of length :math:`N`, basic classical, unstructured search techniques require individual guesses to be evaluated sequentially. This implies a :math:`\mathcal{O}(N)` cost. Though not necessarily prohibitive, this cost behaviour implies that large lists will be difficult to search through as resource limits are reached. :doc:`Grover's algorithm <demos/tutorial_grovers_algorithm>` improved on these techniques by taking advantage of quantum information processing methods, improving cost to :math:`\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})`.

In 2000, the quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) algorithm was put forward as a method to estimate the fraction of states that satisfy a given criterion, if it exists in the set at all [#Brassard2000]_. Here, a superposition state is operated on by the Grover operator :math:`2^n` times in a controlled ladder approach, where :math:`n` is the size of the evaluation register. The rotation and amplification induced by the Grover operator encode an amplitude in an evaluation register indicating the fraction of "good" states that meet the target criterion in a data set, which is obtained through quantum processing via :doc:`quantum Fourier transform (QFT) <demos/tutorial_qft>` to carry out quantum phase estimation (QPE).

Though QAE is a major improvement on the classical case, its reliance on QPE makes it too resource-intensive to run on near-term hardware. This is because QPE depends on QFT, whose circuit width and depth increase rapidly with the intended precision. If we want to, therefore, employ QAE using near-term hardware, we need to find a way to avoid using QPE.

In 2021, an alternative, more efficient method was proposed: Iterative Quantum Amplitude Estimation (IQAE) [#Grinko2021]_. Essentially, IQAE is a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm that breaks down the very deep, very wide circuit approach used in QAE into a series of simpler circuits that execute the Grover operator :math:`k` times sequentially, with the value of :math:`k` changing via classical optimization in each sequential circuit to iteratively "zoom in" on the solution. 

So, rather than trying to take a single-shot approach that requires resources to be allocated to auxiliary registers and controlled applications of the Grover operator, IQAE carries out several oscillations between classical optimizations of :math:`k` and quantum circuit execution and measurement, using the outcome of each quantum iteration to inform the classical step. 

The goal of this demo is to introduce the IQAE algorithm and implement a simple example using PennyLane.

What Are We Looking For?
------------------------
IQAE, like QAE, is specifically focused on analyzing data sets composed of "good" and "bad" states. We can assign each of the subspaces a marker that indicates which of the two categories it falls in. Taking :math:`|0\rangle` to be a "bad" marker and :math:`|1\rangle` to be a "good" marker, the general IQAE state can be defined as

.. math::
   |\Psi_{IQAE}\rangle = \sqrt{1-a}|\psi_0\rangle|0\rangle+\sqrt{a}|\psi_1\rangle|1\rangle,

where :math:`a` is the probability of measuring a "good" state, :math:`|\psi_0\rangle` is a "bad" state, and :math:`|\psi_1\rangle` is a "good" state.

In this implementation, the goal of the IQAE algorithm will be to estimate the fraction of states that are multiples of 8. When encoded in binary, multiples of 8 will always have 0 in the three least significant positions, which serves as a simple success criterion for the algorithm (i.e. a "good" state will always have 0s in the 3 least significant positions). 

To carry this search out, we define an operator :math:`\mathcal{A}` satisfying :math:`\mathcal{A}|0\rangle^{\otimes n+1}=|\Psi_{IQAE}\rangle`, where :math:`n+1` is the number of qubits in the system, including the evaluation qubit. This operator is determined by the application. 

In this case, :math:`\mathcal{A}` prepares a random state and flips an auxiliary qubit via a multi-controlled CNOT gate if the 3 least significant bits adhere to the success criterion (i.e. are they all zero?). If the logic gate is triggered, this single-qubit evaluation register will be flipped to :math:`|1\rangle`, indicating a "good" result. 

In IQAE, the goal is not to estimate the number of "good" results in one sweep. Instead, several iterations will be carried out in which the Grover operator is applied :math:`k` times with the goal of extracting a probability amplitude by refining the interval within which the solution is likely to lie. In doing this, we avoid the expensive QPE procedure used in QAE. To do this, each iteration will yield the general result

.. math::
   \mathcal{Q}^k\mathcal{A}|0\rangle_{bits}|0\rangle_{eval} = \cos((2k+1)\theta_a)|\psi_0\rangle_n|0\rangle_{eval}+\sin((2k+1)\theta_a)|\psi_1\rangle_n|1\rangle_{eval}

where :math:`\mathcal{Q}` is the Grover operator and :math:`\theta_a` is related to the angle by which the state is rotated by Grover's operator (note :math:`a=\sin^2(\theta_a)`), and :math:`k` is the number of times that the Grover operator is applied to the state in a single IQAE iteration. The specifications of this equation are covered thoroughly in [#Brassard2000]_, but the important result is that the probability of measuring a "good" state at the end of an iteration is given by

.. math::
   \mathbb{P}(|1\rangle_{eval})=\sin^2((2k+1)\theta_a).

From this, it is clear that the probability is correlated to the angle imposed by the Grover operator. This relationship can be made clearer by taking into consideration the fact that :math:`\mathcal{Q}` invokes a :math:`2\theta_a` rotation in a 2D space defined by the "good" and "bad" state axes each time it is applied. So, if we can figure out the angle that has been imposed on the state as a result of the operator application, we can obtain the probability of extracting a "good" state. Since we do not aspire to use QPE, our best bet is to use our iterative :math:`k` value combined with a measurement of the quantum circuit that outputs an intermediate amplitude guess. 

The above equation also shows that the size of :math:`k` determines the resolution of the search, with a large :math:`k` corresponding to a high probability oscillation frequency and, therefore, a high resolution. If the frequency becomes too high, however, the measurement outcomes can become ambiguous, once again justifying the iterative approach to ensure an ideal :math:`k` value is found using sequential information collected from the system [#Grinko2021]_.

Defining The Input State and Operators
--------------------------------------
First, we can define the circuit specifications. For this toy example, we will generate a random list of probabilities that will be assigned as weights in the input state.

# As mentioned, the backbone of the quantum portion of the IQAE algorithm is the Grover operator :math:`\mathcal{Q}`, which aims to identify "good" states and introduce an identifiable phase flip and amplitude amplification. The basic structure of :math:`\mathcal{Q}` is 
#
# .. math::
#    \mathcal{Q}=-\mathcal{A}\mathcal{S}_0\mathcal{A}^{-1}\mathcal{S}_{\psi_1}.
#
# In which :math:`\mathcal{S}_{\psi_1}` acts as the oracle and flips the phase of (marks) a "good" state and :math:`\mathcal{S}_0` should flip the phase of the :math:`|0\rangle` state (see figures 1 through 3 in the :doc:`amplitude amplification demo <demos/tutorial_intro_amplitude_amplification>` for an intuitive visualization). Since this is a non-uniform superposition, the operator that facilitates this process needs to be defined rather than using PennyLane's built-in :class:`~.pennylane.GroverOperator` function, which assumes a uniform superposition. 
#
# First, :math:`\mathcal{A}` can be defined according to the following procedure: 
#
# 1. Generate :math:`n` qubits with amplitudes according to the previously generated random probability distribution using :func:`~qp.StatePrep`.
# 2. Flip the state of the 3 final qubits in the string so that :func:`~qp.MultiControlledX` is triggered by a :math:`|111\rangle` state.
# 3. Implement :func:`~qp.MultiControlledX` such that wire :math:`n+1` takes on the :math:`|1\rangle` state if the success criterion is met.
# 4. Flip the state of the 3 final qubits back to the original.

##############################################################################
# Since the "good" state is marked by a :math:`|1\rangle_{eval}`, the :math:`\mathcal{S}_{\psi_1}` operator (also known as the oracle) can be constructed simply using a :func:`~qp.PauliZ()` gate, which will flip the phase of any state that has this marker and allow any state marked by :math:`|0\rangle_{eval}` to pass unchanged. The :math:`\mathcal{S}_0` operator is analogous to a simple :func:`~qp.FlipSign` operation defined to act on the :math:`|0\rangle` state. When designing the operator, the global phase term can be neglected since it does not impact the final measurement in IQAE. It should be noted that this is not the case in canonical QAE, where global phase does make a difference in the final result [#Brassard2000]_.

For small systems (like, for example, 5 qubits), the benefit is negligible but becomes more apparent as the system grows.

# Digesting the FindNextK Function
# --------------------------------
# As shown, the iteration variable :math:`k` is directly tied to the total angle of the state (which can be achieved via measurement of the quantum circuit) since the Grover operator invokes a deterministic rotation each time it is applied. The :math:`\sin^2(x)` function adds complexity to the probability calculations, so standard trigonometric identities can be employed to achieve
#
# .. math::
#    \mathbb{P}(|1\rangle)=\frac{1-\cos((4k+2)\theta_a)}{2}=\frac{1-\cos(K_i\theta_a)}{2}.
#
# Letting :math:`K_i=4k+2` be the frequency.
#
# In [#Grinko2021]_, the authors define ``FindNextK()`` to determine the number of times :math:`\mathcal{Q}` is implemented per iteration. The goal of ``FindNextK()`` is to identify the largest possible :math:`k` that adheres to what is called the **half-plane condition**. The core principle of IQAE is the narrowing of a range of potential amplitudes to, eventually, home in on an accurate estimate of the "good" state probability. To do this, each iteration of the algorithm must operate between an upper and lower bound that make up the function's **confidence interval**, which corresponds to the range of probabilities within which the final probability amplitude will exist. Since the calculation involves a :math:`\arcsin(x)` calculation, it is possible that this confidence interval could yield uninterpretable results if one angle falls in the upper half of the unit circle (i.e. between 0 and :math:`\pi`) and the other falls in the lower half of the unit circle (i.e. between :math:`\pi` and :math:`2\pi`) since information about the measurement's position on the probability curve would be lost. So, having both bounds of the confidence interval on the same half-plane of the unit circle will result in unambiguous knowledge on which branch of :math:`\arcsin(x)` should be used. Thus, valid results should always fall in either the upper or lower half-plane of the unit circle.
#
# .. figure:: ../demonstrations_v2/iterative_quantum_amplitude_estimation/pennylane-demo-iterative-quantum-amplitude-estimation-half-plane-condition.png
#    :align: center
#    :width: 80%
#    :alt: Illustration of scenarios that pass and fail the half-plane condition
#
#    Half-Plane Condition as Defined by [#Grinko2021]_.
#
# The FindNextK function validates this condition. The logic is as follows: 
#
# 1. For an initial guess :math:`k_i` yielding confidence interval :math:`[\theta_{min}^i,\theta_{max}^i]=[\theta_{lower}K_i,\theta_{upper}K_i]`, the function will return the current guess of :math:`k` if either both the upper and lower bounds are less than :math:`\pi` (i.e., they fall in the upper half of the unit circle) or both the upper and lower bounds are greater than :math:`\pi` (i.e. they fall in the lower half of the unit circle). 
# 2. If neither of these conditions are met (i.e., the two bounds fall in different half-planes), the magnitude of the guess needs to be reduced.
#
# To carry out the actual comparison logic, however, some translation is required. First, the maximum possible value of :math:`k` must be defined in relation to the available angles. [#Grinko2021]_ defines this value as
#
# .. math::
#    K_{max} = \lfloor \frac{\pi}{\theta_{max}-\theta_{min}} \rfloor.
#
# Where :math:`K_{max}` can be interpreted as the maximum number of rotations that can be carried out before aliasing becomes an issue.
#
# So, our goal is to find the largest integer :math:`K \leq K_{max}` that both satisfies :math:`K = 4k+2` and adheres to the half-plane condition. This can be carried out using a modulo 4 calculation, which enforces the required condition introduced by :math:`K=4k+2`. Once this is found, the final step is to compute scaling factor :math:`q`, the ratio between the current :math:`K` guess and the previous, which shifts the values relative to the previous step to prevent backsliding. 
#
# The FindNextK function will achieve one of two outcomes. 
#
# 1. Both bounds of the confidence interval fall in the same half-plane, causing the function to return the current :math:`k` guess and a Boolean indicating which half-plane the interval falls in. 
#
# or
#
# 2. The bounds of the confidence interval fall in different half-planes, indicating the current guess is too large. If an adequate guess is not reached as the while loop runs, the previous guess is returned. 
#

# Implementing the IQAE Algorithm
# -------------------------------
#
# With ``FindNextK()`` defined, the IQAE algorithm can now be implemented! The main objective of this function is to apply the :math:`k` value returned by ``FindNextK()`` to the previously defined quantum circuit, obtain a measurement, and determine if this measurement is adequately accurate with respect to a defined tolerance or if the confidence interval should be updated and passed back into the classical function for another iteration. The logic is as follows: 
#
# 1. Call ``circuit()`` after ``FindNextK()`` outputs a guess for :math:`k` and take a probability measurement. 
# 2. Use this value to update the confidence interval, in which both the upper and lower bounds on the angles and probabilities are computed from the measured amplitude. 
# 3. Compute the overlap between the previous confidence interval and the new confidence interval, taking this to be your final upper and lower bound definition. 
# 4. Check to see if the difference between the new upper and lower bounds is smaller than :math:`\epsilon`, which represents a chosen accuracy parameter. If not, pass the final upper and lower bounds back into ``FindNextK()`` and repeat. If yes, return the probability amplitudes associated with the upper and lower amplitudes. 
#
# The confidence intervals can be determined using the Chernoff-Hoeffding bound, where the margin of error is given by :math:`\epsilon_{a_i}` from [#Grinko2021]_.
#
# .. math::
#    \epsilon_{a_i}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{2N_{shots}}\log{\frac{2T}{\alpha}}}.
#
# Where :math:`\epsilon_{a_i}` is the margin of error and :math:`T` defines the maximum number of iterations required to achieve a precision of :math:`\epsilon_{a_i}` and
#
# .. math::
#    T = \lceil \log_{2}{\frac{\pi}{8\epsilon}} \rceil.
#
# We can then estimate the upper and lower bounds of the probability interval estimate.
#
# .. math::
#    p_{max} = \min(1,a_i+\epsilon_{a_i})
#
# .. math::
#    p_{min} = \max(0,a_i-\epsilon_{a_i})

# Conclusion
# ----------
# QAE was put forward as a generalized adaptation of quantum search methods, which hinted at the viability of quantum computers as a notable improvement on existing technologies early on. IQAE pushed forward with this task, showing not only that quantum hardware has the potential to provide advantages in estimation algorithms but that classical feedback loops can be employed to reduce implementation limitations. The implementation shown here does not achieve full quadratic speedup compared to classical estimation methods, but advancements have been subsequently made to meet this metric [#Fukuzawa2023]_. 
# 
# As alluded to, IQAE has the potential to make notable impacts in various applications, such as in the calculation of expectation values in applications like quantum chemistry. Proposals have also been put forward to employ IQAE in areas such as risk analysis, financial portfolio modelling and optimization, and power grid analysis. The true feasibility of using IQAE (and, really, any other quantum algorithm) in these applications will become clearer as quantum hardware advances in capability and usability. 
# 
# There are, of course, limitations to IQAE's feasibility, particularly that the circuit depth grows with the number of iterations. Despite this, IQAE shows an example of how quantum-classical hybrid approaches can be used to achieve speedup compared to classical methods and resource requirement reduction compared to other quantum methods.

r"""X-ray absorption spectroscopy simulation in the time domain
===========================================================

What will be the first industrially useful quantum algorithm to run on fault-tolerant quantum computers? 
This open question is being tackled head-on by the research team at Xanadu, as it aligns with our goal of making quantum computers that are useful.
In particular, we believe promising candidates for early quantum advantage are simulations of *small* but *highly correlated* systems. 
One such application is simulating `X-ray absorption spectroscopy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_absorption_spectroscopy>`__ (XAS), which can be useful in workflows for identifying structural degradation mechanisms in material candidates for battery designs 🔋 [#Fomichev2024]_. 
This demo will show you how to implement an optimized simulation algorithm developed in the paper `“Fast simulations of X-ray absorption spectroscopy for battery materials on a quantum computer” <https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15784>`__ [#Fomichev2025]_ in PennyLane.

First, we will discuss why simulating X-ray absorption spectroscopy was identified as a promising application for early quantum computers. 
Then we will explain the main steps in the simulation algorithm and how to
implement a simplified version in PennyLane.

    :class: note

    We will be using concepts that were introduced in other PennyLane demos, such as `Using PennyLane with PySCF and OpenFermion <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qchem_external>`__, `Initial state preparation for quantum chemistry <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_initial_state_preparation>`__, and `How to build compressed double-factorized Hamiltonians <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_how_to_build_compressed_double_factorized_hamiltonians>`__.

Why simulate X-ray absorption spectroscopy?
-------------------------------------------

Lithium-excess materials are transition metal oxides that are designed as candidate materials for battery cathodes. 
Engineered to accommodate extra Lithium atoms in their structural composition, these materials enable larger energy densities in battery designs.
However, repeated charge-discharge cycles can alter their structure and reduce performance. 
The oxidation states in the degraded cathode materials can be examined using X-ray absorption spectroscopy, which directly probes local structure by exciting tightly bound core electrons. 
The degraded structures are identified by a process known as “spectral fingerprinting”, where reference spectra of small molecular clusters are matched to the experimental spectrum. 
A fast method of simulating reference spectra for use in fingerprinting would be a crucial component in an iterative workflow for identifying promising cathode materials [#Fomichev2024]_.

   Figure 1: *How simulation of X-ray absorption spectra can enable identification of oxidation states in candidate battery materials.* 
   Spectral fingerprinting can be used to identify constituent structures of a material by matching experimental spectra with simulated spectra.

Simulating these spectra is a difficult task for classical computers -- the highly correlated excited states are hard to compute classically, particularly for clusters with transition metals. 
However, the low number of electronic orbitals needed to simulate these small clusters make this calculation well suited for early fault-tolerant quantum computers, which can naturally handle the large amount of correlations in the electronic state. 
Tasks like this are promising candidates for early quantum advantage -- simulations of *small* but *highly correlated* systems. 

Algorithm
---------

Simulating reference spectra requires calculating the observable of the experiment, which in this case is the `absorption cross section <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_cross_section>`__.
We will describe this quantity below and then explain how a *time-domain* simulation algorithm can estimate it.

Observable: absorption cross-section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In XAS experiments, the absorption cross section :math:`\sigma_A` as a function of the incident X-ray frequency :math:`\omega` is measured for a given material. 
This is proportional to the rate of absorption of X-ray photons of various energies. 
For our situation, the electrons in the molecular cluster start in a ground molecular state :math:`|I\rangle` with energy :math:`E_I`. 
This ground state will be excited to states :math:`|F\rangle` with energies :math:`E_F` by the radiative field through the action of the dipole operator :math:`\hat m_\rho,` where :math:`\rho` is any of the Cartesian directions :math:`\{x,y,z\}`.

The absorption cross section is given by

.. math::  \sigma_A(\omega) = \frac{4 \pi}{3 \hbar c} \omega \sum_{F \neq I}\sum_{\rho=x,y,z} \frac{|\langle F|\hat m_\rho|I \rangle|^2 \eta}{((E_F - E_I)-\omega)^2 + \eta^2}\,,

where :math:`c` is the speed of light, :math:`\hbar` is Planck’s constant, and :math:`\eta` is the line broadening, set to match the experimental resolution of the spectroscopy. 
Below is an illustration of an X-ray absorption spectrum.

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/xas/example_spectrum.png
   :alt: Illustration of X-ray absorption spectrum with five peaks of varying positions and peak heights.
   :width: 50.0%
   :align: center

   Figure 2: *Example X-ray absorption spectrum.* Illustration of how the peak positions :math:`E_F - E_i`, widths :math:`\eta` and amplitudes :math:`|\langle F | \hat m_\rho | I \rangle|^2` determine the spectrum.

The goal of this demo is to implement a quantum algorithm that can calculate this spectrum. 
Three algorithm designs are discussed in [#Fomichev2024]_, but we will focus on the time-domain method, since quantum computers are naturally suited to calculating the time evolution of a Hamiltonian operator. 
Instead of computing the energy differences and state overlaps directly, this method simulates the system in the time domain, and then uses a `Fourier transform <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform>`__ to obtain the spectrum in frequency space *all at once*.

Quantum algorithm in the time-domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both the initial state :math:`|I\rangle` and the dipole operator acting on the initial state :math:`\hat m_\rho|I\rangle` can be determined classically, and we’ll demonstrate how to do that later. 
With the initial state computed, we will use a mathematical trick called a *frequency-domain* `Green’s function <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_function>`__ to determine the absorption cross section. 
We can write the cross section as the imaginary part of the following Green’s function (see Section IIB in [#Fomichev2025]_)

.. math:: \mathcal{G}_\rho(\omega) = \langle I|\hat m_\rho \frac{1}{\hat H -E_I -\omega +i\eta} \hat m_\rho |I\rangle\,.

Using a resolution of identity of the final states and simplifying, we end up with

.. math::  \mathrm{Im}\mathcal{G_\rho(\omega)} = -\sum_{F\neq I} \frac{|\langle F|\hat m_\rho|I\rangle|^2\eta}{(E_F- E_I -\omega)^2 +\eta^2} - \frac{|\langle I|\hat m_\rho|I\rangle|^2\eta}{\omega^2 +\eta^2}\,,

where the first term is clearly proportional to the absorption cross section. 
The second term is zero if we centre the frame of reference for our molecular orbitals at the nuclear-charge weighted centre for our molecular cluster of choice. 

Okay, so how do we determine :math:`\mathcal{G_\rho(\omega)}`? 
If we are going to evaluate this quantity in a quantum register, it will need to be normalized, so instead we are looking for

.. math::  G_\rho(\omega) = \eta \frac{\mathcal{G}_\rho(\omega)}{||\hat m_\rho | I \rangle ||^2} \,.

There are methods for determining this frequency-domain Green’s function directly [#Fomichev2024]_. 
However, our algorithm will aim to estimate the discrete-time *time-domain* Green’s function :math:`\tilde G(t_j)` at times :math:`t_j`, where :math:`j` is the time-step index.
:math:`G_\rho(\omega)` can then be calculated classically through the discrete time-domain Fourier transform

.. math::  -\mathrm{Im}\,G_\rho(\omega) = \frac{\eta\tau}{2\pi} \sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty e^{-\eta |t_j|} \tilde G(t_j) e^{i\omega t_j}\,,

where :math:`\tau \sim \mathcal{O}(||\hat H||^{-1})` is the size of the time step. 
This step should be small enough to resolve the largest frequency components that we are interested in, which correspond to the final states with the largest energy. 
In practice, this is not the largest eigenvalue of :math:`\hat H`, but simply the largest energy we want to show in the spectrum.

Now, this all comes together because the time-domain Green’s function can be determined using the expectation value of the time-evolution operator (normalized)

.. math::  \tilde G_\rho(t_j) = \frac{\langle I|\hat m _\rho e^{- i\hat H t_j} \hat m_\rho |I\rangle}{|| \hat m_\rho |I\rangle ||^2}\,,

and this is something that can be easily done on a quantum computer! 
We can use a `Hadamard test <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_test>`__ circuit with the unitary of time evolution to measure the expectation value for each time :math:`t_j`. 
Repeating this test a number of times :math:`N` and taking the mean of the results gives an estimate for :math:`G_\rho(t_j)`, which we can Fourier
transform to get the spectrum.

   :alt: Illustration of full Hadamard test circuit with state prep, time evolution and measurement.
   :width: 70.0%
   :align: center

   Figure 3: *Circuit for XAS simulation*. 
   The algorithm is ultimately a Hadamard test circuit, and we divide it into three components.

The circuit we will construct to determine the expectation values is shown above. It has three main components:

- *State prep*, the state :math:`\hat m_\rho |I\rangle` is prepared in the quantum register, and an auxiliary qubit is prepared for controlled time evolution.
- *Time evolution*, the state is evolved under the electronic Hamiltonian.
- *Measurement*, the time-evolved state is measured to obtain statistics for the expectation value.

Let’s look at how to implement these steps in PennyLane. 
We will make extensive use of the :mod:`pennylane.qchem` module, as well as initial state preparation methods from `PySCF <https://pyscf.org/>`__. 

State preparation
-----------------

We need to classically determine the ground state :math:`|I\rangle`, and the dipole operator’s action on that state :math:`\hat m_\rho |I\rangle`. 
For complicated molecular clusters, it's common to choose and consider only a subset of molecular orbitals and electrons in a calculation. 
This set of orbitals and electrons is known as the “active space”. 
Utilizing an active space reduces the cost of performing calculations on complicated molecular instances, while hopefully still preserving the interesting features of the molecule. 
For this demo, our calculation will use the :math:`\mathrm{N}_2` molecule with a small active space. 
While the molecule used here is quite simple, the method demonstrated below will work for more complicated molecules. 

Ground state calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you haven’t, check out the demo `“Initial state preparation for quantum chemistry” <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_initial_state_preparation>`__. 
We will be expanding on that demo with code to import a state from the `complete active space configuration interaction <https://pyscf.org/user/mcscf.html>`__ (CASCI) methods of PySCF, where we restrict the set of active orbitals used in the calculation. 

We start by creating our molecule object using the `Gaussian type orbitals <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_orbital>`__ module ``pyscf.gto``, and obtaining the Hartree-Fock molecular orbitals with the `self-consistent field methods <https://pyscf.org/user/scf.html>`__ ``pyscf.scf``.

#     PennyLane uses the physicists' notation, where the spatial orbitals are ordered, and the spins alternate up and down. 
#     When changing a state from one convention to the next, the sign of some state amplitudes need to change to adhere to the Fermionic anticommutation rules. 
#     The helper function :func:`~.pennylane.qchem.convert._sign_chem_to_phys` does this sign adjustment for us.

# Nice! Our time-domain simulation method reproduces the classical spectrum.
# Looking closely, we can see there are two strong peaks, as predicted from the beat note in the expectation values in Figure 7.

# The spectrum calculated from the full orbital space is shown in Section V in [#Fomichev2025]_.

#
# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# In this tutorial, we have implemented a simplified version of the algorithm as presented in [#Fomichev2025]_. 
# The algorithm represents a culmination of many optimizations for time evolving an electronic Hamiltonian. 
# We’ve also discussed how XAS simulation is a promising candidate application for early fault-tolerant quantum computers due to its low qubit overhead but high amount of correlations in the state space.

# Appendix: Further optimizations
# ---------------------
# 
# There are more optimizations for this algorithm that are included in the paper [#Fomichev2025]_ that we did not implement in the above code. 
# One could further optimize the compressed double-factorized Hamiltonian by applying a block-invariant symmetry shift (BLISS) [#Loaiza2023]_ to the Hamiltonian prior to the factorization. 
# This is already detailed in the `demo on CDF Hamiltonians <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_how_to_build_compressed_double_factorized_hamiltonians>`__.
#
# Another optimization is to use a randomized second-order Trotter formula for the time evolution. 
# As discussed in [#Childs2019]_, the errors in deterministic product formulas scale with the commutators of the Hamiltonian terms. 
# One could instead use all permutations of the Hamiltonian terms, such that all of the commutator errors cancel. 
# However, the average of all permutations is not unitary in general. 
# To circumvent this, one can randomly choose an ordering of Hamiltonian terms in the Trotter product, which can give a good approximation to the desired evolution.
#
# Core-valence separation approximation
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# For larger molecular instances, a simplifying approximation is to restrict the excited states in the calculation to only include those of relevance for XAS, which are states where a *core* electron is excited, i.e. there exists a hole in the core orbitals. 
# These are known as core-excited states, and lie significantly above the valence-excited states in energy. 
# Typically the frequency range is focused on a target atom in a molecular cluster, and also near a transition energy, such as targeting core :math:`1s` electrons.
#
# .. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/xas/core_valence.png
#    :alt: Energy diagram with X-rays exciting core electrons to high valence energies, and UV and visible radiation only excite electrons already in valence orbitals.
#    :width: 50.0%
#    :align: center
#
#    Figure 9: *Core-valence separation.* A much larger amount of energy is required to excite core electrons into valence orbitals compared to electrons already in low-lying valence orbitals. 
# 
# We can also turn off the two-electron terms that couple core-excited and valence-excited states. 
# The terms are in general small, but by setting them to zero that coupling is removed entirely from the time evolution. 
# To implement the core-valence separation approximation in an XAS simulation algorithm, there are two steps:
# 
# - Before performing compressed double factorization on the two-electron integrals, remove the terms that include at least one core orbital.
# - Remove all the matrix elements from the dipole operator that do *not* include at least one core orbital.
# 
# This approximation would be useful when simulating a complex molecular instance, such as a cluster in a lithium-excess material.

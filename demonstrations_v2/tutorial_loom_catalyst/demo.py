===================

Running computations on physical systems inevitably means confronting imperfections-what we commonly
refer to as noise. Noise, by definition, is any deviation from the ideal behaviour of a system as it
evolves, and it’s a constant feature of our physical world. This reality becomes even more
pronounced in quantum computing. Quantum states are intrinsically fragile, which impedes the
implementation of practical algorithms on quantum computers. While quantum hardware companies are
building increasingly large and complex multi-qubit systems, a significant challenge lies in
managing the errors caused by noise in quantum information processing and devising ways to correct
them.

**Quantum Error Correction (QEC)** is a method to protect quantum information using redundant
encoding. In QEC, a “code” is used to store a single qubit of information in the state of multiple
physical qubits, so that it is possible to determine and recover errors on the individual qubits
protecting the logical information. The sapient use of entanglement allows us to be as close as
possible to perfect, noiseless qubits. The difficulty in QEC is that the implementation of error
correction is itself error-prone. When the error detection and correction procedures can correct
errors faster than they cascade, we speak of Fault-Tolerant Quantum Error Correction (FTQEC). This
design methodology ensures that a quantum computation can tolerate errors, so that QEC can remain
effective in time throughout the execution of a quantum algorithm.

Quantum error correction stands as one of the great frontiers in quantum computing. It gives the
ability to take noisy and imperfect physical qubits, and create perfect and ideal logical
qubits-paving the way for truly useful quantum computations. This promise hinges on three key
technical components:

- Low-noise physical qubits
- A control system of exceptional precision
- Software capable of executing the QEC protocol

In this demo, we’ll delve into foundational concepts in QEC theory, with a particular focus on the
software layer. We’ll start here by implementing a simple, naive QEC protocol directly in Catalyst,
leveraging one of its greatest strengths--seamlessly integrating classical and quantum routines
within a single program through its connection with JAX. From there, we’ll explore the limitations
of this naive approach and then move to Loom, Entropica Labs’ platform for designing, orchestrating,
and automating quantum error correction experiments, to refine the protocol and scale it up.

Classical error correction
--------------------------

At the heart of quantum error correction (QEC) lies a powerful concept: using many imperfect
physical systems to simulate a single qubit that is far more resilient to noise than any one system
on its own. In doing so, QEC distinguishes between two layers of abstraction-noisy physical qubits
and ideal logical qubits protected from noise through error correction. To ground this idea, we can
borrow intuition from classical error correction. One of the simplest schemes is the repetition
code. The concept is straightforward: replicate the information multiple times. For instance, you
could use three bits to represent a single logical bit by encoding:

.. math::  0 \rightarrow 000, \quad 1 \rightarrow 111, 

where on the right side, you have the encoded bit. If you want to perform a logical NOT operation,
you simply flip all the bits:

.. math::  000 \rightarrow 111, \quad 111 \rightarrow 000. 

Now, consider a noisy environment, where each physical bit has a probability :math:`p` of flipping.
When reading a logical bit, you check all three physical bits and take a **majority vote**. If
:math:`p` is small, then seeing something like :math:`010` likely means the middle bit was corrupted
by noise. You can confidently correct it by flipping it back, restoring the original :math:`000`
state.

This works well in classical systems—but quantum computing introduces a twist: **you cannot create
an exact copy of an arbitrary quantum state**. The no-cloning theorem forbids creating identical
copies of a quantum system while preserving the original. So, we can’t just copy a quantum state and
vote on the outcome later. However, all is not lost. Quantum mechanics offers a uniquely powerful
alternative: **entanglement** coupled with a clever protocol to detect and correct errors. Instead
of duplicating quantum states, we use entanglement to **distribute** quantum information across
multiple physical qubits.

The simplest QEC code: the quantum repetition scheme
----------------------------------------------------

A QEC scheme is a method for constructing logical qubits that are more robust to noise than the
underlying *physical qubits*. To understand how this works, let’s begin with the simplest example:
the **quantum repetition code**.

Unlike classical bits, qubits can experience several types of errors:

- Bit-flip :math:`(X)`: swaps :math:`\vert 0 \rangle  \leftrightarrow  \vert 1 \rangle`
- Phase-flip :math:`(Z)`: swaps :math:`\vert + \rangle  \leftrightarrow  \vert - \rangle`
- Combined :math:`(Y)`: a simultaneous bit- and phase-flip, represented as :math:`iXZ`
- Other: such as amplitude damping, depolarizing, etc

Repetition codes are the most basic form of quantum error correction. While they’re conceptually
easy to understand, they are not very powerful and can only correct *bit-flip* errors. We’ll see why
this limitation exists by the end of the demo.

In classical error correction, redundancy is added by directly copying bits. But in quantum
computing, the no-cloning theorem prevents copying arbitrary quantum states. Instead, redundancy is
introduced *indirectly*, using **entanglement** and **syndrome extraction**. Setting up a QEC scheme
involves three main steps:

1. **Define how logical qubits are encoded** within the physical system
2. **Extract information about possible errors**, without disturbing the logical state
3. **Infer the error from that information** and apply the appropriate correction

Drawing from the classical repetition code, we can encode one logical qubit across three physical
qubits:

.. math::  \alpha \vert 0 \rangle + \beta \vert 1 \rangle \rightarrow  \alpha \vert 000 \rangle + \beta \vert 111\rangle. 

This entangled state now represents a single logical qubit across three physical ones.

The circuit below shows how to generate the logical qubit. As discussed, this is done by creating an
entangled state across three physical qubits—laying the groundwork for robust error correction
through QEC.

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/loom_catalyst/encode_qubits.png
    :align: center
    :width: 70% 

To detect and later correct any errors in this system, we introduce a **syndrome extraction
circuit**, which operates in three phases:

1. **Introduce auxiliary qubits**: These auxiliary qubits don’t carry any logical information.
   Instead, they’re used solely to probe for errors.
2. **Entangle data and auxiliary qubits**: This step allows the auxiliary register to “pick up”
   error information-called the syndrome-without directly measuring the data qubits.
3. **Measure the auxiliary qubits**: The measurement reveals a pattern (the syndrome) that tells us
   where and what kind of error has likely occurred.

Based on the syndrome measurements, we infer the specific error-say, a bit-flip on qubit 2-and apply
the corresponding recovery operation to restore the logical state.

After encoding the logical qubit, we add another two qubits, the auxiliary qubits. 

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/loom_catalyst/parity_meas.png
    :align: center
    :width: 70%

At this point, we’re working with **five qubits** in total: three data qubits that define the
logical qubit, and two auxiliary qubits used for extracting the error syndrome (we have gone a long
way to get a single, ideal logical qubit!). The circuit in the previous image concludes with
measurements on the two auxiliary qubits, yielding two classical bits of information–the **syndrome
signature**.

For this simple enough case, we can go through all the possible errors and see what happens to the
syndrome signature. Recall that a Pauli-:math:`X` gate flips :math:`Z`-basis eigenstates
:math:`(\vert 0 \rangle  \leftrightarrow  \vert 1 \rangle).` To simulate an error, we insert an
:math:`X` gate after preparing the logical state but *before* running the syndrome extraction
circuit. We obtain four cases illustrated below.

    :width: 75%

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/loom_catalyst/syndrome11.png
    :align: center
    :width: 75%

As it is easy to verify, the three locations where the error may arise give rise to an independent
signature over the measurement outcomes. Explicitly writing the match between syndromes and
corrections is called generating the “look up table”.

Catalyst implementation
-----------------------

Let’s walk through how to implement a *quantum memory* experiment using **Catalyst** and **Loom**. A
memory experiment involves running several cycles of a quantum error correction code, recording the
resulting *syndrome measurements*, and using them to determine the appropriate error corrections. To
build such an experiment, we need three key components:

1. **Syndrome extraction circuit** responsible for capturing information about any errors affecting
   the data qubits.
2. **Syndrome decoder** which analyzes that information and identifies the most likely error that
   occurred.
3. **A mechanism to link the two** enabling the decoded syndrome to be translated into real-time
   corrective actions.

Let’s implement this natively using the PennyLane and Catalyst frameworks, relying on the hard-coded
solution known as “look-up table”.

# So, we can correct some of the errors, but not all. The main limitation is that our current QEC
# scheme can only handle bit-flip errors—and only those that occur after the syndrome extraction

# 
# Conclusions
# -----------
# 
# We like to think of quantum error correction as a classic steam engine—steadily chugging through
# three essential steps: entangling the data and auxiliary qubits, extracting the syndrome by
# measuring the auxiliaries, and then decoding and correcting any detected errors. Once this engine is
# up and running, it keeps going until the computation is complete, tirelessly counteracting the
# physical noise that plagues any real-world quantum system.
# 
# In this demo, we explored some of the core concepts behind QEC theory. More importantly, we
# demonstrated how to integrate these components into a single hybrid workflow. We used Loom to design
# the experiment at a high level, and Catalyst to compile both quantum and classical routines into a
# unified program—exactly what’s needed to keep this error-correcting engine in motion.
# 
# What next? Well, one can start exploring how to perform actual computations on these logical
# qubits--and, step by step, transition from simple repetition codes to more sophisticated quantum
# error correction engines. I mean, codes!

Solving systems of linear equations is important for a wide range of industries, such as healthcare,
transportation, finance, chemistry, and even quantum computing. The Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) algorithm can implement matrix inversion to solve such
equations on a quantum computer [#chuang2021]_. For more information on how to use PennyLane's
:func:`~.pennylane.qsvt` functionality to run matrix inversion on a quantum computer see our demo on `QSVT in
Practice <tutorial_apply_qsvt>`_.

It turns out that the bottleneck of QSVT is
typically the cost of encoding the matrix onto a quantum computer in the first place! While this **data loading** cost is
significant for any general matrix, in real life our problems often have patterns and structure!

By exploiting the structure of a problem, we can significantly reduce the quantum resource cost of the algorithm, thereby making QSVT based matrix inversion more accessible to implement on nearer term fault-tolerant quantum
hardware.

This demo, based on our recent paper `Quantum compilation framework for data loading
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05183>`_ [#linaje2025]_, will showcase an optimized block encoding strategy that
uses the sparsity of the matrix to significantly reduce the cost of QSVT. We will focus on a particular matrix
inversion problem that arises in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) [#lapworth2022]_.

Problem Setup
-------------
The two-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow (2D-LDC) is a canonical benchmark in CFD for verifying numerical
schemes that solve the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. Determining the
fluid flow within the cavity requires solving the pressure correction equations by inverting the associated
pressure correction matrix (:math:`A`). A key observation is that :math:`A` is highly structured and sparse.
The figure below highlights the non-zero entries of :math:`A` with a dimensionality of :math:`(64 \times 64)`
[#lapworth2022]_.

To invert this matrix using QSVT, we will need to **load** it onto the quantum computer using a block encoding.
The standard technique for block encoding any (square) matrix :math:`A` is the method of `linear combination of
unitaries (LCUs) <tutorial_lcu_blockencoding>`_. However, it suffers from a few fatal flaws (try saying that five
times fast).

The number of terms in the LCU scales as :math:`O(4^{n})` in the number of qubits, and thus the cost of the block
encoding also scales exponentially. Even computing the LCU decomposition becomes a computational bottleneck.
Furthermore, there is no way of knowing a priori how many terms there will be in the LCU. For these reasons, a
general "one size fits all" block encoding scheme is usually too expensive for our systems of interest.

.. _naive_block_encoding:
Resource cost of naive block encoding
------------------------------------------
Let's explore the average cost of block encoding a matrix in the standard way. We suppose that this matrix has size :math:`2^{20} \times 2^{20}` and can be written as the superposition of $4^{20}$ Pauli words. Note that not all matrices of that size can be written in this manner, so the resulting resource estimate is not necessarily general. However, it does illustrate the cost of naively block encoding a particular matrix of this size. 

.. code-block:: python

   import pennylane.estimator as qre
   
   num_qubits = 20
   matrix_size = 2**num_qubits
   
   lcu_A = qre.PauliHamiltonian(
       num_qubits = num_qubits,
       pauli_terms = {"Z"*(num_qubits//2): 4**num_qubits},
   ) # 4^20 Pauli words comprise this matrix
   
   def Standard_BE(prep, sel):
       return qre.ChangeOpBasis(prep, sel, qre.Adjoint(prep))
   
   Prep = qre.QROMStatePreparation(num_qubits)  # Preparing a single qubit in the target state
   Select = qre.SelectPauli(lcu_A)  # Select the operators in the LCU
   
   resources = qre.estimate(Standard_BE)(Prep, Select) # Estimate the resource requirement
   print(resources)


With one line, we can see that that the estimated T gate cost of naive block encoding this matrix is :math:`1 \times 10^{12}`. This block encoding is called many times within an instance of the QSVT algorithm, and can be the dominant cost. Now that we have established a baseline of the `standard' cost, we ask: Can we do better? 

Yes! We leverage the **structure** of our matrix to implement a much more efficient block encoding operator.


Exploiting structure in the block encoding
------------------------------------------
This matrix (:math:`A`) can be block encoded using a *d-diagonal encoding* technique [#linaje2025]_ developed
by my colleagues here at Xanadu. The method loads each diagonal in parallel, then shifts them to their respective
ranks in the matrix. The values along each diagonal can be sparsely represented in a different basis, which
further reduces resources than existing state-of-the-art methods. The quantum circuit that implements the
d-diagonal block encoding is presented below. To learn more, read our paper: `"Quantum compilation framework for
data loading" <https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05183>`_.

Estimating the resource cost for this circuit may seem like a daunting task, but we have
PennyLane's quantum resource :mod:`~.pennylane.estimator` to help us construct each piece!

Diagonal Matrices & the Walsh Transform
------------------------------------------------
Each :math:`D_{k}` is a block-diagonal operator that contains the normalised entries from the :math:`k^{\text{th}}`
diagonal of our d-diagonal matrix :math:`A`. By multiplexing over the :math:`D_{k}` operators, we can load all of
the diagonals in *parallel*.

Instead of implementing each :math:`D_{k}` as a product of :class:`~.pennylane.ControlledPhaseShift` gates,
we leverage the Walsh transformation [#zylberman2025]_. The Walsh transform allows us to naturally
optimize the cost of our block encoding by tuning the number of Walsh coefficients within :math:`[1, N]`,
where :math:`N` is the size of the matrix. If the entries in our diagonal are sparse in the Walsh basis,
as is the case for the CFD example, then we can get away with far fewer Walsh coefficients. This results in
a much more efficient encoding. The circuit below prepares a single such Walsh diagonal block encoding,
ultimately we need to prepare as many operators as non-zero diagonals in :math:`A`.

# Conclusion
# ----------
# In this demo, we showed how we can exploit knowledge about the structure of our matrices to build a more
# efficient block encoding. This work brings us one step closer to implementing quantum linear solvers on near
# term quantum hardware. If you are interested in other subroutines for data loading, including state preparation,
# and how to optimize them, check out our paper: `Quantum compilation framework for data loading <https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05183>`_.
#
# Along the way we showcased PennyLane's :mod:`~.pennylane.estimator` module to determine the resource
# requirements for **matrix inversion by QSVT**. You learned how to build complex circuits from our library of
# primitives, making resource estimation as simple as putting together Lego blocks. Of course, QSVT has many other
# applications, from unstructured search, phase estimation and even Hamiltonian simulation. We challenge you to
# think of smarter data loading techniques to reduce the quantum cost of QSVT for these applications as well!

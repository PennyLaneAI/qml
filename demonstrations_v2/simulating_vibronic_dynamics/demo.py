Simulating Vibronic Dynamics
############################

Simulating static properties will not get us very far.

It is difficult to find an advancement in science or technology that did not
happen through a painstaking process of trial and error. For most of human
history, testing new ideas was only possible in the slow, costly physical world,
making many avenues impossible to explore. With the advent of computers,
this changed. The ability to digitally simulate ideas significantly accelerated
the development cycle of new technologies and cut costs, leading to a substantial increase in the pace of human
innovation.

When it comes to simulating complex quantum effects, classical simulation 
is well poised to handle systems that, for the most part,
stay still. Ground state energies and other static quantities are good heuristics,
but the simulations we need to carry out to continue progressing areas
such as advanced materials discovery are dynamical in nature. This is something 
classical computers just can't seem to crack. 

In theoretical chemistry, classical simulations tend to take the 
`Born-Oppenheimer approximation
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born%E2%80%93Oppenheimer_approximation>`_, which 
assumes electrons and nuclei can be treated as completely separate entities. 
This works very well for ground state energies and simplifies molecular systems
adequately for classical systems to handle. 

When we go beyond Born-Oppenheimer to model dynamic systems, 
it is no longer possible to isolate
electronic degrees of freedom (DOFs) from nuclear DOFs, meaning their paths
cannot be simulated separately. Long story short, if we want to capture the
realistic dynamics of a molecular system, we lose access to approximations that
allow for a reduction in the number of simulation variables and, as a result,
the size of the system will very quickly exceed standard computational
resources. This is true when we set out to simulate `vibronic systems <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibronic_coupling>`, which is specifically concerned with these vibrational
interactions between electrons and nuclei.

In `"Quantum Algorithm for Vibronic Dynamics"
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13669>`_ Motlagh et al. propose a novel quantum
algorithm for vibronic simulations. This algorithm leverages several quantum
tools including :doc:`phase gradient states <demos/efficient_rotations_with_phase_gradient_states>`, 
:doc:`QROM
coefficient loading <demos/tutorial_intro_qrom>`, and, foundationally, :doc:`Trotterization <demos/exploring_trotterization>` to reach
beyond Born-Oppenheimer and toward more realistic, capable dynamic simulations.

Why don't we add this to our quantum toolkits!

The Köppel-Domcke-Cederbaum Hamiltonian
---------------------------------------
The Köppel-Domcke-Cederbaum (KDC) Hamiltonian is a well known, straightforward
representation of a vibronic system in which the electronic and nuclear
vibrational modes are coupled. It takes the general
form
 
.. math:: 
   H = \mathcal{I}_{el} \otimes (T_{nuc}+V_0)+\textbf{W}

where :math:`T_{nuc}` is the vibrational
kinetic operator, :math:`V_0` is the reference 
potential energy operator, and
:math:`\textbf{W}` is a coupling matrix representing the diabatic
potential [#Motlagh2025]_. The source paper defines this potential
in a truncated quadratic vibronic coupling (QVC) model as

.. math:: 
   \mathbf{W}'_{ij}(\vec{Q})=\lambda^{(i,j)}+\sum_r a_r^{(i,j)}Q_r+\sum_{r,r'} b_{r,r'}^{(i,j)}Q_rQ_{r^\prime}.

We can interpret this expression by understanding :math:`\lambda^{(i,j)}`,
:math:`a_r^{(i,j)}`, and :math:`b_{rr'}^{(i,j)}` as coupling coefficients and
:math:`\vec{Q_r}` as mode-dependent position operators (with :math:`r` being a specific mode) [#Motlagh2025]_. In this truncation, we deal with only the linear and quadratic coordinate terms, which is 
adequate to both shrink error and ensure implementability.

We can take the kinetic and potential operators as

.. math:: 
   T=\mathcal{I}_{el} \otimes \sum_{r=0}^{M-1}\frac{\omega_r}{2}P_r^2

and

.. math:: 
   V =\sum_{i,j=0}^{N-1}|j\rangle\langle i| \otimes V_{ji}

respectively, where :math:`\mathcal{I_el}` is the electronic space identity operator,
:math:`P` is the momentum operator,
:math:`V_{ji}` represents the sum of the expansion of
:math:`\textbf{W'}` in coefficient form and the ground-state 
potential :math:`V_0`.

Carrying out a time evolution of the KDC Hamiltonian is useful for applications such as 
spectroscopy and energy transfer dynamics, among other things. For this
demonstration, we will aim to simulate electronic state evolution for a
small, simple system. 

Let's get started.

Grid Encoding
-------------
To keep our operations efficient, it is important to select a space
representation that allows for easy basis transformation. In classical 
computation, it is difficult to use real space for simulations due to the exponential
memory requirements of storing a grid-encoded wave packet. However, using real space provides optimal conditions 
for implementing our Hamiltonian since we can represent both position and momentum operators diagonally,
pending a simple change of basis. This is a clear advantage of using quantum computers
to carry out vibronic simulations. Since memory is not a main bottleneck in the quantum case,
we are free to use real space as we please!

To do this, we need to define the grid on which our system will exist. 
Letting the total number of required
grid points for a given mode be :math:`K` (from which we can determine the number of required
qubits in the system :math:`k=\log_2(K)`) and taking the computational basis states to 
represent the position basis, we can define the 
:math:`Q` operator as

.. math::
   Q|x\rangle = \Delta(x-K/2)|x\rangle,

where :math:`\Delta=\sqrt{2\pi/K}` is the grid spacing term and :math:`x` is a
position-basis grid point index. It is more convenient to work in the signed integer representation

.. math::
   Q|x\rangle = \Delta \cdot x |x\rangle

for our implementation, letting :math:`x \in \{-\frac{K}{2}, -\frac{K}{2}+1, \dots, \frac{K}{2}-1\}`. This discretization dictates the 
size of our space and the number of qubits required for our system.

Fragmentation and Diagonalization
---------------------------------
The Motlagh et al. vibronics algorithm is, at its core, a :doc:`Trotterization algorithm <demos/exploring_trotterization>`.
To review, Trotterization is a Hamiltonian
simulation method that addresses the issue of exponentiating non-commuting terms in
a Hamiltonian. In this method, a target Hamiltonian is separated into groups of commuting operators called *fragments* to be
individually exponentiated and interleaved in partial time steps to simulate time evolution.

To implement these fragments in a circuit, they must be diagonal. Unfortunately for us, off-diagonal terms
run rampant in vibronic systems due to the high degree of coupling. Thus, a complete Trotter step
should include a diagonalization procedure.

So, each Trotter step in our implementation should:

1. Perform a kinetic half-step on the system,
2. Diagonalize each fragment to represent coupling behaviour,
3. Perform a potential step for each fragment,
4. Uncompute the diagonalization step,
5. Perform another kinetic half-step on the system.

To address this, Motlagh et al. lay out a Clifford gate based
scheme for `block-diagonalization
<https://pennylane.ai/compilation/diagonal-unitary-decomp/details>`_. To understand the scheme, we must first take
each Hamiltonian fragment to be expressed as the operator

.. math:: 
   H_m = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1}|j\rangle \langle m \oplus j|\otimes
   V_{j,m\oplus j},

where :math:`m` and :math:`j` are electronic state indices. 
Since :math:`|j\rangle \langle m \oplus j|\otimes` constructs the matrix geometry of
the fragment, the difference between :math:`j` and :math:`m\oplus j` (representing the `Hamming
weight <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight>`_ in this case) will describe a fragment's proximity
to a diagonal configuration and 
dictate how the block should be treated. The logic is as follows:

1. IF :math:`m=0`, we are dealing with a diagonal fragment. Our work here is
   done!
2. IF :math:`j` and :math:`m\oplus j` differ by 1, we can achieve
    diagonalization by sandwiching the fragment between Hadamard gates.
3. ELSE, pick one of the differing (off-diagonal) bit positions to act as a control for CNOT operations 
    targetting all other differing bits. This reduces the Hamming weight to 1,
    enabling diagonalization via a Hadamard gate acting on the control bit.

###############################################################################
# In the KDC Hamiltonian, it is intuitive to fragment our expression into kinetic
# terms and potential terms. As defined, each has its own specifications, so we will
# treat them individually.
#
# The Kinetic Step
# ----------------
# The kinetic energy fragment is, comparatively, simple to establish
# and evolve in time, so we willd deal with it first. 
# Cutting to the chase, the kinetic step should, for each mode:
#
# 1. Perform a change of basis on the input state to momentum space,
# 2. Square the corresponding mode's register and store the result in an ancillary register,
# 3. Apply a rotation to the state register via a :doc:`phase gradient register <demos/efficient_rotations_with_phase_gradient_states>`,
# 4. Uncompute the ancillary register. 
#
# We also know that the kinetic energy coefficients will always be proportional to
# :math:`P^2` and will be independent of the electronic state. This makes our lives easy! Rather than loading
# state-dependent coefficients into the system, we can simply encode calculated
# coefficients into the initial state. 
# 
# An intuitive way to understand these
# coefficients is to take them as describing the motion of the nuclear states. If
# the kinetic term coefficient is equal to 0, the nucleus is frozen and, 
# therefore, there is nothing vibronic to simulate.
#
# Motlagh et al. specify the basis transformation should take place via the sequence
#
# .. math::
#   P = QFT^\dagger X_{k-1} Q X_{k-1} QFT
#
# in which the X-gates are applied as a means of bit-ordering. 
#
#
# Once the
# basis has been switched, an
# :func:`~qp.OutPoly` operation targeting :math:`f(x)=(x-K/2)^2` (which is
# equivalent to :math:`x^2` in the signed-integer picture) can be used to carry
# out the squaring operation on the state register.
#
# To apply the rotation step, a :doc:`phase gradient <demos/efficient_rotations_with_phase_gradient_states>`
# approach will be implemented.
# Phase gradient rotations work by storing a pre-computed, catalytic state that
# holds position-dependent rotation angles. Via quantum addition, these angles can be
# applied to corresponding qubits to carry out cheap rotations. It takes the
# general form
#
# .. math::
#    |R\rangle = \frac{1}{2^{b/2}}\sum e^{i2\pi y/2^b}|y\rangle,
#
# where :math:`b` is the number of wires in the gradient register and determines the
# precision of the rotation.
#
# A major benefit of using phase gradients is they only need to be prepared
# once, since the addition step does not have any impact on the state. To carry out the addition
# without error, we will perform a wire offset step that selects a "subregister", using only a 
# portion of the available wires and shifting the binary representation. This virtual indexing
# reduces the wire requirements of this addition step, making our classical demonstration
# more feasible. This is mathematically
# equivalent to carrying out a `logical left shift
# <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_shift>`_ in classical computing. 
#
# The result of this procedure is a set of target states that have
# accumulated a phase equivalent to the change incurred during a given
# kinetic time step.

# 
# The Potential Step
# ------------------
# The goal of the potential energy step is to construct the full potential
# energy operator (with coefficients) for each electron state and coupled
# vibrational state. To do this, we
# must consider the state-dependent potential coefficients and the vibrational
# modes of the system. The operations that will need to be carried out by this
# function are:
#
# 1. Load the electron state-dependent coefficient terms into the coefficient
#    register,
# 2. If there are multiple vibrational mode states involved in this step,
#    multiply them together,
# 3. Multiply the full mode state (either a single mode or the product of
#    multiple modes, depending on step 2) with the coefficient register,
# 4. Add the product of the mode state and coefficient register to the phase
#    gradient register,
# 5. Uncompute.
# 
# To facilitate loading, the state-dependent coefficients must be determined and stored
# in a bit-position-dependent fashion prior to Trotterization. For now, we
# will assume that this has been handled and simply passed into our
# potential step function for use.
#
# As shown in our QVC representation of :math:`\textbf{W'}`, we are only
# concerned with scenarios with one or two mode states. Thus, in the case our system 
# is quadratic, we need to apply an :func:`~qp.OutPoly`
# operator that multiplies the two mode registers together, just like we did in
# the kinetic step. Otherwise, no arithmetic required. The outcome of either of these
# cases is added to the phase gradient register via quantum arithmetic multiplier-adder
# gates, inducing the corresponding rotation.

# in terms of the desired rotation precision :math:`\delta`. This is the main
# driver of resolution for our task.

# Initial State Definition
# ------------------------
# In "Quantum Algorithm for Vibronic Dynamics", the initial state of the KDC
# system is taken to be a simple vertical excitation represented in product form
# in relation to electronic state :math:`j` as 
#
# .. math:: |\psi_0\rangle = |j\rangle_{el}
#    \bigotimes_{r=0}^{M-1}|\chi_0\rangle.
#
# Here,
#
# .. math:: |\chi_0\rangle = \frac{1}{Z}\sum_{x=0}^{K-1}
#    \exp\left(\frac{-\pi \cdot (x-\frac{K}{2})^2}{K}\right) |x\rangle
#
# is the Hermite-Gauss function representation of the harmonic oscillator ground
# state, where :math:`Z` is a normalization constant and :math:`x` is, again, a
# position-basis grid point index. It is stated that one can choose to begin
# with a superposition state to enable functionalities such as spectroscopy. In
# this demo, we will be targeting a simple electronic state population time
# evolution, so an initial superposition is not necessary. This state can be
# generated using ``KDCStatePrep()``.

# Implementation
# --------------
# Finally, we have adequately built up the skeleton of our
# simulation!
#
# To keep things simple (and computationally feasible), we will begin by
# defining a small system with 2 electron states and 1 vibrational mode. 
# The potential coefficients will be taken to be a simple array of values
# that will soon be scaled by the required factors. It is worth noting that the
# flooring step in the kinetic energy coefficient calculation requires a minimum
# number of precision bits to be present in the system to avoid flooring to 0
# and, therefore, suppressing all coupling effects. As such, ``delta`` should be
# small enough to achieve :math:`b\geq 6`.
#
# In the source paper, the
# full coefficient representation is given as
#
# .. math:: \Delta^{\alpha}c^{(j,j)}_\alpha
#
# where :math:`\alpha` is the expansion degree of the polynomial term. Taking the bit-wise representation and
# considering the time dependence, the full representation of the coefficients
# that should be passed into the QROM is
#
# .. math:: c_{time}=[c_{\alpha} \Delta^\alpha \frac{dt}{2} \frac{2^b}{2\pi}] \text{mod}
#    2^b
#
# This form allows for easy computation and conversion to the list-of-bit format
# required by the QROM. For this demo, :math:`\alpha` will be fixed to 1 since
# we are only dealing with linear mode behaviour. This can be easily changed
# depending on the needs and conditions of the system.

#Introduce scaling factor and reformat for compatibility with QROM

# Conclusion
# ----------
# Preparing to make the most out of quantum technologies is crucial as we
# continue to move toward accessible, useful quantum devices. Identifying areas
# of interest that are known to be important to researchers, companies, and
# individuals is an important first step. Vibronic simulation has the potential
# to expand our capacity for material discovery, renewable energy expansion, and
# drug exploration. In `"Quantum algorithm for simulating non-adiabatic dynamics
# at metallic surfaces" <https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16264>`_, the authors
# employ similar techniques to simulate vibronic dynamics using a GAN Hamiltonian.
# Give it a read and test your new skills!

r"""Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET)
=========================================
Computer simulations of materials are very challenging. Mean field methods are inexpensive, but they are unreliable and inconsistent in describing strongly correlated systems. More accurate simulations can be obtained with wavefunction approaches such as configuration interaction or coupled cluster, but these are extremely expensive, becoming prohibitive even for relatively small systems.

Embedding theories provide a path to simulate materials with a balance of accuracy and efficiency.
The core idea is to divide the system
into two parts: an impurity, which is a strongly correlated subsystem that requires a high accuracy
description, and an environment, which can be treated with a more approximate but computationally
efficient level of theory.

#############################################
# In this demo, we will describe density matrix embedding theory (DMET) [#SWouters]_, a
# wavefunction-based approach that embeds the ground state density matrix. We provide a brief
# introduction of the method and demonstrate how to run DMET calculations to construct a Hamiltonian
# that can be used in quantum algorithms using PennyLane.
#
# Theory
# ------
# The ground state wavefunction for an embedded system composed of an impurity and an environment can be
# represented as [#SWouters]_:
#
# .. math::
#
#      | \Psi \rangle = \sum_i^{N_I} \sum_j^{N_E} \psi_{ij} | I_i \rangle | E_j \rangle,
#
# where :math:`I_i` and :math:`E_j` are respectively the basis states of the **impurity** :math:`I` and **environment**
# :math:`E`, :math:`\psi_{ij}` is the matrix of coefficients, and :math:`N` is the
# number of sites, e.g., orbitals. The key idea in DMET is to perform a singular value decomposition
# of the coefficient matrix :math:`\psi_{ij} = \sum_{\alpha} U_{i \alpha} \lambda_{\alpha} V_{\alpha j}`
# and rearrange the wavefunctions as:
#
# .. math::
#
#      | \Psi \rangle = \sum_{\alpha}^{N} \lambda_{\alpha} | A_{\alpha} \rangle | B_{\alpha} \rangle,
#
# where :math:`A_{\alpha} = \sum_i U_{i \alpha} | I_i \rangle` are states obtained from rotations of
# :math:`I_i` to a new basis, and :math:`B_{\alpha} = \sum_j V_{j \alpha} | E_j \rangle` are **bath states**
# representing the portion of the environment that interacts with the impurity [#Mineh]_. Note
# that the number of bath states is equal to the number of impurity states, regardless of the size
# of the environment. This representation is simply the `Schmidt decomposition <https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05703v1>`_
# of the system wave function.
#
# We are now able to project the full Hamiltonian to the space of impurity and bath states, known as
# the embedding space:
#
# .. math::
#
#      \hat{H}_{\text{emb}} = P^{\dagger} \hat{H} P,
#
# where :math:`P = \sum_{\alpha \beta} | A_{\alpha} B_{\beta} \rangle \langle A_{\alpha} B_{\beta}|`
# is a projection operator. A key point about this representation is that the wavefunction,
# :math:`|\Psi \rangle`, is the ground state of both the full system Hamiltonian :math:`\hat{H}` and
# the smaller embedded Hamiltonian :math:`\hat{H}_{\text{emb}}` [#Mineh]_.
#
# Note that the Schmidt decomposition requires a priori knowledge of the ground-state wavefunction. To alleviate
# this, DMET operates through a systematic iterative approach, starting with a mean field description
# of the wavefunction and refining it through feedback from solutions of the impurity Hamiltonian, as we describe below.
#
# Implementation
# --------------
# The DMET procedure starts by getting an approximate description of the system's wavefunction.
# Subsequently, this approximate wavefunction is partitioned with the Schmidt decomposition to get
# the impurity and bath orbitals. These orbitals are then employed to define an approximate projector
# :math:`P`, which is used to construct the embedded Hamiltonian. Then, accurate methods such as
# quantum algorithms are employed
# to find the energy spectrum of the embedded Hamiltonian. The results are used to
# re-construct the projector and the process is repeated until the wavefunction converges.
#
# Let's now implement these steps for a linear chain of 8 Hydrogen atoms. We will use the
# programs PySCF [#pyscf]_ and libDMET [#libdmet]_ [#libdmet2]_ which can be installed with
#
# .. code-block:: python
#
#    pip install pyscf
#    pip install git+https://github.com/gkclab/libdmet_preview.git@main
#
# Constructing the system
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# We begin by defining a finite system containing a hydrogen chain with 8 atoms using PySCF. This is
# done by creating a ``Cell`` object containing the Hydrogen atoms. We construct the system to have
# a central :math:`H_4` chain with a uniform :math:`0.75` Å :math:`H-H` bond length, flanked by two
# :math:`H_2` molecules at its endpoints.

#
# Then, we construct a ``Lattice`` object using libDMET and associate it with the defined cell.

#    filling = cell.nelectron / (lattice.nscsites * 2.0)
#
#
# Performing mean field calculations
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# We can now perform a mean field calculation on the whole system through Hartree-Fock with density-fitted
# integrals, following the procedures outlined in the `PySCF documentation <https://pyscf.org/user/pbc/df.html>`_.
#
# .. code-block:: python
#
#    gdf = df.GDF(cell, lattice.kpts)
#    gdf._cderi_to_save = 'gdf_ints.h5' # output file for the integrals
#    gdf.build()                        # compute the integrals
#    kmf = scf.KRHF(cell, lattice.kpts, exxdiv=None).density_fit()
#    kmf.with_df = gdf                  # use density-fitted integrals
#    kmf.with_df._cderi = 'gdf_ints.h5' # input file for the integrals
#    kmf.kernel()                       # run Hartree-Fock
#
# This provides us with an approximate description of the whole system.
#
# Partitioning the orbital space
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# Now that we have a full description of our system, we can start obtaining the impurity and
# bath orbitals. We will use a localized orbital basis which provides a convenient way to understand
# the contribution of each atom to the properties of the full system. We can use any localized basis
# such as molecular orbitals (MO) or intrinsic atomic orbitals (IAO) [#SWouters]_. Here, we rotate
# the one-electron and two-electron integrals into the IAO basis.
#
# .. code-block:: python
#
#    from libdmet.basis_transform import make_basis
#
#    ao_to_iao_transform, _, _ = make_basis.get_C_ao_lo_iao(
#    lattice, kmf, full_return=True)
#    ao_to_lo_transform = lattice.symmetrize_lo(ao_to_iao_transform)
#    lattice.set_Ham(kmf, gdf, ao_to_lo_transform, eri_symmetry=4) # rotate to IAO basis
#
# Next, we identify the orbital labels for each atom in the unit cell and define the impurity and
# bath by looking at the labels. We achieve this by utilizing a minimal basis
# to categorize orbitals: those present in the minimal basis are identified as valence,
# while the remaining orbitals are deemed virtual. In this example, we choose to keep the :math:`1s` orbitals in the
# central :math:`H_4` chain in the impurity, while the bath contains the :math:`2s` orbitals and
# the orbitals belonging to the terminal Hydrogen molecules form the environment.
#
# .. code-block:: python
#
#    from libdmet.lo.iao import get_labels, get_idx
#
#    orb_labels, val_labels, virt_labels = get_labels(cell)
#    imp_idx = get_idx(val_labels, atom_num=[2,3,4,5])
#    bath_idx = get_idx(virt_labels, atom_num=[2,3,4,5], offset=len(val_labels))
#    core_idx = []
#    lattice.set_val_virt_core(imp_idx, bath_idx, core_idx)
#
# Now that we have a description of our impurity, bath and environment orbitals, we can implement
# our DMET simulation.
#
# Self-Consistent DMET
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# The DMET calculations are performed by repeating four steps iteratively:
#  - Construct an impurity Hamiltonian
#  - Solve the impurity Hamiltonian
#  - Compute the full system energy
#  - Update the interactions between the impurity and its environment
# To simplify the calculations, we create dedicated functions for each step and implement them in a
# self-consistent loop. If we only perform one iteration, the process is referred to as single-shot DMET.
#
# We now construct the impurity Hamiltonian.

# Hamiltonian to a qubit Hamiltonian that can be used in a quantum algorithm using PennyLane.

#
# Conclusion
# ^^^^^^^^^^
# Density matrix embedding theory is a robust method designed to tackle simulation of complex
# systems by partitioning them into manageable subsystems. It is particularly well suited for
# studying the ground state properties of strongly correlated materials and molecules. DMET offers a
# compelling alternative to dynamic quantum embedding schemes such as dynamic mean field theory. By
# employing the density matrix for embedding instead of the Green's function and
# utilizing the Schmidt decomposition to get a limited number of bath orbitals, DMET achieves a
# significant reduction in computational resources. Furthermore, a major strength lies in its
# compatibility with quantum algorithms, enabling the accurate study of smaller, strongly correlated
# subsystems on quantum computers while the environment is studied classically. Its successful
# application to a wide range of strongly correlated molecular and periodic systems underscores its
# power and versatility in electronic structure theory, paving the way for hybrid quantum-classical
# simulations of challenging materials [#DMETQC]_.

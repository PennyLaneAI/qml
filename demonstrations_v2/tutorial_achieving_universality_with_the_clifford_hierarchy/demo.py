r"""Achieving universality with the Clifford hierarchy
==========================

Maybe you have heard of the 'Gottesman-Knill' rule: :doc:`Clifford circuits are efficient to simulate <demos/tutorial_clifford_circuit_simulations>` but cannot provide quantum advantage on their own. We also know we need non-Clifford gates (like the $T$ gate) to reach universality [#anynonclifford]_. But why the `$T$ gate specifically <https://pennylane.ai/compilation/clifford-t-gate-set>`__? Why not a random rotation?

It turns out there is a rigorous structure hidden beneath these gates. The Clifford hierarchy explains exactly how 'quantum' a gate is, how hard it is to correct, and why specific gates act as the 'magic' fuel for fault-tolerant computation.

In this demo, we will dig deeper into the levels of gates that make up the Clifford hierarchy (the Pauli group, the Clifford group, non-Clifford sets, and more), see how they are related (and how to implement them with gate teleportation!), and what this all means for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC).


The trouble with universality and quantum error correction
---------------------------------

It would be nice if we were certain that applying a finite sequence of gates could approximate any arbitrary quantum state --- a property called universality [#universality]_. However, Clifford gates such as the :class:`Hadamard <pennylane.Hadamard>` $H$, :class:`Phase<pennylane.S>` $S$, or :class:`CNOT<pennylane.CNOT>` gates and all Pauli gates :math:`\{X,Y,Z\}` are not enough because they can only achieve :math:`90^{\circ}` or :math:`180^{\circ}` rotations on the Bloch sphere. That means, if you had a single qubit initially in the :math:`|0\rangle` state, no matter the sequence of Clifford gates you apply, you can only ever reach 6 points on the Bloch sphere: the :doc:`stabilizer states <demos/tutorial_stabilizer_codes>`. 

It turns out that all you need to achieve universal quantum computing are the Clifford gates and at least one non-Clifford gate [#qecbook]_! In principle, you could select any non-Clifford gate, but a common gate set is `(Clifford+T) <https://pennylane.ai/compilation/clifford-t-gate-set>`__. 

The :class:`T <pennylane.T>` gate applies a :math:`45^{\circ}` rotation about the $Z$ axis. On the surface, this doesn’t seem too special --- but with the addition of a non-Clifford gate, the `Solovay-Kitaev theorem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solovay%E2%80%93Kitaev_theorem>`__ guarantees that any state can be approximated by a finite sequence of gates. This gate sequence can be found via methods such as the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm [#SK_alg]_ or gridsynth [#gridsynth]_. Putting all these pieces together, we can now obtain, say, a :math:`1^{\circ}` rotation about the $Z$ axis to a :math:`10^{-2}` error with a sequence of $T$, $H$, and $S$ gates. 

For `noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) <https://pennylane.ai/blog/2023/06/from-nisq-to-isq>`__ computing, the story ends here. The problem arises when trying to achieve **both** universal **and** fault-tolerant quantum computing. 

Realistic quantum hardware is noisy, and so quantum data must be protected with `quantum error correction (QEC) codes <https://pennylane.ai/codebook/quantum-error-correction>`__ to achieve `fault-tolerance <https://pennylane.ai/topics/fault-tolerant-quantum-computing>`__. Note that a fault-tolerant implementation of a quantum gate can be obtained for free *if* that gate can be implemented transversally, because transversal gates limit the propagation of errors. Many QEC codes such as the :doc:`CSS <demos/tutorial_stabilizer_codes>`, colour, surface, and :doc:`qLDPC <demos/tutorial_qldpc_codes>` codes have transversal implementations of Clifford gates. 

However, the `Eastin-Knill theorem <https://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.4262>`__ dictates that there can be no quantum error correction code that can implement both Clifford and non-Clifford gates transversally. Hence, the same QEC codes as above that implement Clifford gates fault-tolerantly cannot implement non-Clifford gates fault-tolerantly. 

So, it appears that we are stuck: Either we perform fault-tolerant but non-universal quantum computing, or we perform universal but non-fault-tolerant quantum computing. Is there some way we can implement non-Clifford gates in these QEC codes fault-tolerantly and non-transversally?  


If only there was some relationship between non-Clifford gates and Clifford gates that we can exploit...

Clifford and Pauli gate relations
---------------------------------

The core idea of the Clifford hierarchy lurks beneath many of the concepts you may already know: relationships between different gates can be exploited to simplify computation. For example, Clifford-only quantum circuits are known to be efficiently simulatable classically, as proven by the `Gottesman-Knill theorem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottesman%E2%80%93Knill_theorem>`__. 

:doc:`Stabilizer tableau simulation <demos/tutorial_clifford_circuit_simulations>` is one such method. If $Z$ is a stabilizer corresponding to the state :math:`|0 \rangle`, then the application of a Clifford gate such as $H$ transforms the stabilizer to become :math:`HZH^{\dagger} = X` corresponding to the new state :math:`H |0 \rangle = |+ \rangle`. For any Clifford gate, $C$, and for all Pauli gates :math:`P \in \{X,Y,Z\}`, observe that it is always true that the transformation :math:`CPC^{\dagger}` yields a Pauli gate up to a global phase. 

In other words, Clifford gates map Pauli gates to Pauli gates under conjugation. As my colleague wrote in this :doc:`demo <demos/tutorial_clifford_circuit_simulations>`, one can exploit this fact to efficiently track how stabilizers evolve through a Clifford-only circuit. :doc:`Pauli propagation <demos/tutorial_classical_expval_estimation>` exploits a similar idea to accelerate the classical calculation of circuits' expectation values. `Pauli frame tracking <https://pennylane.ai/compilation/pauli-frame-tracking>`__ uses a similar idea to decouple the decoding step of quantum error correction from Clifford gate execution. 

What do non-Clifford gates map Pauli gates to? Does that mapping help us simplify computation too? 

The Clifford Hierarchy
---------------------------------

It turns out that there is a structure connecting infinite classes of gates called the Clifford hierarchy [#gottesmanchuang]_. Exploiting this hierarchy can help us implement any non-Clifford gate fault-tolerantly. 


Pauli group (:math:`\mathcal{C}_1`)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the bottom of this hierarchy is the Pauli group, which contains the familiar Pauli gates and their tensor products :math:`\mathcal{C}_1 = \{X, Y, Z\}^{\otimes n}` for :math:`n` qubits.


Clifford group (:math:`\mathcal{C}_2`)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Members of the Clifford group map Pauli gates to Pauli gates under conjugation, up to a global phase. Formally, 

.. math::

    \mathcal{C}_2 = \{U: UPU^{\dagger} \in \mathcal{C}_1,~ \forall P \in \mathcal{C}_1\}.
    

Members of this group include the Hadamard gate $H$, phase gate :math:`S = \sqrt{Z}`, and the :math:`\mathrm{CX}`, :math:`\mathrm{CY}`, and :math:`\mathrm{CZ}` gates. As an example, they conjugate Paulis like so: :math:`HZH^{\dagger} = X` and :math:`SYS^{\dagger} = -X`. The global phase of :math:`\pm 1` is neglected when determining if a gate resides in a Clifford hierarchy level. Notice that the entire Pauli group lives within the Clifford group (e.g., :math:`XZX^{\dagger} = -Z`), i.e., :math:`\mathcal{C}_1 \subset \mathcal{C}_2`. 


:math:`\mathcal{C}_3` set
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Members of :math:`\mathcal{C}_3` map :math:`\mathcal{C}_1` gates to :math:`\mathcal{C}_2` gates under conjugation, up to a global phase i.e., 

.. math::

    \mathcal{C}_3 = \{U: UPU^{\dagger} \in \mathcal{C}_2,~ \forall P \in \mathcal{C}_1\}.

Examples of members of this group include the :math:`T = \sqrt{S}` gate, the Toffoli gate, and :math:`\mathrm{CCZ}` gate. For example, the $T$ gate conjugates Pauli gates like so: :math:`TXT^{\dagger} = e^{-i \pi/4} SX \sim SX` and :math:`TYT = -e^{-i\pi/4} XS \sim XS`. The :math:`\sim` represents the equivalence up to a global phase. To show that $XS$ is in fact Clifford, we can perform explicit computation. :math:`(XS)X(XS)^{\dagger} = -Y`, :math:`(XS)Y(XS)^{\dagger}=-X`, and :math:`(XS)Z(XS)^{\dagger}=-Z`. If we ignore the global phase of $-1$, we can see that the result of conjugation is a Pauli gate, which proves that $XS$ is in fact a Clifford gate. A similar result follows for $SX$. 


:math:`\mathcal{C}_k` set
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

More generally, the :math:`k^{\mathrm{th}}` level of the Clifford hierarchy for :math:`k\geq 2` is:

.. math::
    
    \mathcal{C}_k = \{U: UPU^{\dagger} \in \mathcal{C}_{k-1},~ \forall P \in \mathcal{C}_1 \}.

The Pauli and Clifford groups constitute the foundation of infinitely nested sets of gates. Note that applying a control to the :math:`C^{(k-1)}X` or :math:`C^{(k-1)}Z` gate in :math:`\mathcal{C}_k` yields a gate in the :math:`k+1^{\mathrm{th}}` level, as does taking the square root of the :math:`Z^{(1/2)^{k-1}}\in \mathcal{C}_k` rotation gate [#climbdiagonal]_, [#controlledgates]_, [#climb]_. :math:`\mathcal{C}_k` is non-empty because it contains at least :math:`R_Z(m \pi/2^k)` where $m$ is any integer [#qecbook]_. Because there can be infinitesimally fine $Z$-rotations, there are infinitely many non-empty $C_k$ sets, and :math:`\mathcal{C}_1 \subset \mathcal{C}_2 \subset \dots \subset \mathcal{C}_k \subset \mathcal{C}_{k+1} \subset \dots`.


Achieving universal FTQC with the Clifford hierarchy
---------------------------------

With the Clifford hierarchy, we can fault-tolerantly implement a :math:`\mathcal{C}_3` gate with only :math:`\mathcal{C}_2` gates via gate teleportation [#gottesmanchuang]_. Gate teleportation builds on top of :doc:`state teleportation <demos/tutorial_teleportation>` à la Alice and Bob. Recalling that many QEC codes cannot implement a non-Clifford gate transversally, Alice cannot simply apply a transversal non-Clifford gate on her top qubit in :ref:`Figure 1 <fig-1-universal-gate-teleportation>` without possibly introducing irrecoverable noise. 

.. _fig-1-universal-gate-teleportation:

.. figure:: ../_static/demonstration_assets/universality_and_clifford_hierarchy/Figure-1-universal-gate-teleportation.png
  :alt: Universal gate teleportation circuit.
  :width: 95%
  :align: center

  Figure 1: *A universal gate teleportation circuit applies a third level gate to the state using only gates in the second level and measurements, given a magic state (left of the dashed line).*
  
So, as shown in :ref:`Figure 1 <fig-1-universal-gate-teleportation>`, suppose we apply a gate :math:`U\in \mathcal{C}_3` on Bob’s half of the Bell state pair on the bottom, and proceed with :math:`|\psi\rangle` teleportation as usual. We won't worry about how Bob can apply $U$ but Alice can't just yet. Suffice to say, Bob has a :doc:`magic state <demos/tutorial_magic_states>`. 🪄

Upon measuring the top two qubits, like in standard state teleportation, a Pauli error $P$ occurs on the bottom qubit. There is an equal chance of :math:`P \in \{X,Y,Z,I\}` occurring. For state teleportation, applying :math:`P^{\dagger}=P` removes that error. However, the difference here with gate teleportation is that Bob applied $U$ already. So, after measurement, the bottom qubit becomes :math:`UP|\psi\rangle`. Applying :math:`P^{\dagger}` does not remove the Pauli error. 

To see how we can overcome this, let's apply the identity :math:`I=U^{\dagger} U` to obtain :math:`UP I |\psi\rangle = UPU^{\dagger}U|\psi\rangle = CU|\psi\rangle`. Observe that this method has reversed the order of the gates so that $C$ is now exposed while $U$ is applied to the state :math:`|\psi\rangle` first. By the Clifford hierarchy, $C$ must be a Clifford gate. As discussed above, many QEC codes can implement Clifford gates fault-tolerantly. Thus, with the knowledge of $P$ from the Bell state measurement, :math:`C^{\dagger} = UPU^{\dagger} = C` can be applied to produce :math:`U|\psi\rangle`, the desired non-Clifford gate. This procedure, known as magic state injection, generalises to the n-qubit case. 

An example code for a $C_3$ teleportation circuit is given below: 
"""

import pennylane as qp

dev = qp.device('default.qubit', wires=3)

    qp.cond(m0 & (m1 == 0), z_corr)() # If we measure |10>
    qp.cond(m0 & m1, xz_corr)() # If we measure  |11>

    return qp.density_matrix(wires=2)

##########################################
# Let's now check the circuit gives the expected result,
# by computing the correct answer directly from the
# density matrix:

U_mat = qp.matrix(target_gate, wire_order=[0])(0)
initial_dm = np.outer(initial_state, np.conj(initial_state))
correct_answer = U_mat @ initial_dm @ np.conj(U_mat).T
print(correct_answer)

##########################################
# Comparing this to our universal teleportation circuit,
# we can see that it matches:

result = universal_teleportation(initial_state)
print(result)
print(np.allclose(result, correct_answer))


##########################################
# Observe that :math:`(UPU^{\dagger})^{\dagger}` in practice is implemented as simply the reverse of the conjugation. 
# 
# 
# 
# The challenge of implementing the :math:`\mathcal{C}_3` gate, $U$, fault-tolerantly has been shifted to fault-tolerantly preparing the *magic state* :math:`(I \otimes U)(|00\rangle+|11\rangle)/\sqrt{2}` offline. The key idea is: We can prepare numerous, potentially noisy, candidate magic states in advance, and only allow the sufficiently clean states to be consumed to enable teleportation. Although magic states are a broader idea, the term is often used to mean :doc:`magic states for $T$ gates <demos/tutorial_magic_states>` specifically. There are a few ways to prepare magic states fault-tolerantly such as :doc:`magic state distillation <demos/tutorial_magic_state_distillation>`. The remainder of the circuit consists of Clifford (:math:`\mathcal{C}_2`) gates and Bell basis measurements, which have fault-tolerant implementations in common QEC codes. Therefore, we can fault-tolerantly implement both Clifford and non-Clifford gates despite the Eastin-Knill theorem! 
# 
# What is more, this teleportation circuit provides a systematic method to teleport any :math:`\mathcal{C}_k` gate, so long as you have access to :math:`\mathcal{C}_{k-1}` gates. If :math:`\mathcal{C}_{k-1}` gates are not fault-tolerantly implemented in your QEC code of choice, then you may use additional teleportation circuits that produce lower level gates until you reach the fault-tolerant gate set. :ref:`Figure 2 <fig-2-universal-teleportation-c4>` below shows an example of nested teleportation circuits to implement a :math:`\mathcal{C}_4` gate for a QEC code that transversally implements Clifford gates. The first Bell basis measurement applies :math:`C_4 \in \mathcal{C}_4` with some Pauli error $P_4$. Conjugation implies we must apply :math:`C_3^{\dagger} = (C_4 P_4 C_4^{\dagger})^{\dagger} = C_3 \in\mathcal{C}_3` correction gate. For a QEC code that does not implement this type of gate transversally, we use another teleportation circuit. That teleportation circuit induces a Pauli error $P_3$ that must be corrected in the manner described above. It can be confirmed through computation that the final result is :math:`C_4 |\psi\rangle`.

# Teleportation is more efficient with semi-Clifford gates
# ---------------------------------
# 
# While the universal teleportation circuit above can implement any non-Clifford gate in the Clifford hierarchy fault-tolerantly, it still isn't clear why the $T$ gate is commonly used to enable universality. To see that, let's be greedy: How can we teleport gates more efficiently? 
# 
# If a gate is semi-Clifford i.e., it can be written as $U = G_b V G_a$, where $V$ is a diagonal matrix in :math:`\mathcal{C}_k` and $G_a$ and $G_b$ are each Clifford gates, then the resource cost of gate teleportation can be **halved** [#onebit]_. All one- and two-qubit gates in :math:`\mathcal{C}_k` are semi-Clifford, as are three-qubit gates in :math:`\mathcal{C}_3` [#semiclifford]_. Importantly, the $T$ gate is diagonal, which is a subset of semi-Clifford gates with $G_b = G_a = I$.
# 
# To explain why semi-Clifford gates can be teleported more efficiently, we firstly depict these more efficient 'one-bit' teleportation circuits. There are two such flavours: $Z$-teleportation and $X$-teleportation, named after the classically controlled correction these circuits apply. :ref:`Figure 4a <fig-4-one-bit-teleportation>` depicts the general one-bit $Z$-teleportation circuit for $U$, :ref:`Figure 4b <fig-4-one-bit-teleportation>` depicts the general one-bit $X$-teleportation circuit for $U$, and :ref:`Figure 4c <fig-4-one-bit-teleportation>` depicts the one-bit teleportation circuit for the $T$ gate. The section within the dashed box is a :doc:`magic state <demos/tutorial_magic_states>`. 
#

# 
#   Figure 4: *One-bit teleportation circuits. (a) Z-teleportation, (b) X-teleportation, and (c) $T$ gate teleportation.*
# 
# 
# Here, conjugating the $U$ gate across the :math:`D \in \{Z,X\}` Pauli error creates the term :math:`UDU^{\dagger}`, which must be Clifford if $U$ is in :math:`\mathcal{C}_3` and $D$ is Pauli as per the Clifford hierarchy. Semi-Clifford-ness allows us to move the $U$ gate to before the CNOT gate. Just as before, the part of the circuit up to the $U$ gate is called a magic state, which can be prepared in advance. Therefore, if the magic state is available, then a semi-Clifford gate such as the $T$ gate can be implemented fault-tolerantly. 
# 
# The one-bit teleportation protocol halves the number of ancilla qubits, measurements, and gates compared to the general two-bit teleportation protocol above. Note that the diagonal $V$ in $U = G_b V G_a$ need not commute with the CNOT gates because you are always free to select $X$-teleportation. All diagonal gates commute with the control part of a CNOT gate. For this reason, this circuit can implement a controlled-Hadamard gate, which does not commute with CNOT [#onebit]_. 
# 
# Recursive application of this one-bit teleportation circuit leads to the implementation of semi-Clifford :math:`\mathcal{C}_k` gates. :ref:`Figure 5 <fig-5-one-bit-teleportation-c4>` illustrates an example of X-teleportation of a semi-Clifford :math:`C_4\in\mathcal{C}_4` gate assuming that only :math:`\mathcal{C}_2` gates are implemented transversally. This means we must use two teleportation circuits in total.

# 
# Now, we have an efficient method to teleport certain non-Clifford gates! 
# 
# 
# So, what's so special about the T gate?
# ---------------------------------
# Adding any non-Clifford gate to a set of Clifford gates provides universality. The $T$ gate often appears as the non-Clifford gate of choice, but it’s just a :math:`45^{\circ}` rotation about the $Z$ axis. What’s so special about the $T$ gate? Why not a gate that implements a :math:`1^{\circ}` rotation? Or why not a Toffoli or a controlled-phase gate? 
# 
# Gates above :math:`\mathcal{C}_3` in the Clifford hierarchy are eliminated because they require more resources to implement because of the need for nested teleportation circuits, as shown in the above figures. 
# 
# Within :math:`\mathcal{C}_3`, we should restrict ourselves to semi-Clifford gates to let us use the more efficient teleportation circuits. That means we should only consider one-, two-, or three-qubit gates [#semiclifford]_, such as the $T$ gate, controlled-phase gate, controlled-Hadamard gate, and Toffoli gate. The gate that requires the fewest resources overall is the $T$ gate because it is a single-qubit diagonal gate (i.e., $G_a=G_b=I$). With these arguments, it is clear why the $T$ is often the non-Clifford gate of choice. 
# 
# One can inject a $T$ gate via the circuit presented in :ref:`Figure 4c <fig-4-one-bit-teleportation>`, or using the circuit below. Additional explanation of the circuit below can be found `in this magic states glossary entry <https://pennylane.ai/glossary/what-are-magic-states>`__.

# Conclusion
# ---------------------------------
# 
# We have seen how the Clifford hierarchy enables universal and fault-tolerant quantum computing by mapping higher level gates down to lower level gates. The same hierarchy also ranks gates by the number of resources needed to implement them fault-tolerantly, thus how 'quantum' they are and how gates can be considered as magic fuel for fault-tolerance. 
# 
# Although the Clifford hierarchy was first proposed in the context of universality [#gottesmanchuang]_, its ideas lurk underneath other topics. For example, `Pauli frame tracking <https://pennylane.ai/compilation/pauli-frame-tracking>`__ conjugates Clifford gates to avoid having to physically execute correction Pauli gates [#pauliframetracking]_. 
# 
# Not only $T$ gates can be implemented fault-tolerantly; the Clifford hierarchy shows how an enormous class of gates can be implemented fault-tolerantly. For example, the diagonal $C-U$ gates that perform period finding for `Shor’s algorithm <https://pennylane.ai/codebook/shors-algorithm>`__ , the :doc:`quantum Fourier transform <demos/tutorial_qft>`, and in :doc:`quantum phase estimation (QPE) <demos/tutorial_qpe>` can be implemented fault-tolerantly using the teleportation circuits shown in the above sections.

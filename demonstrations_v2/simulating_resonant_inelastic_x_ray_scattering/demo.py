Simulating Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering
##############################################

Lithium excess (Li-excess)
platforms are currently being eyed for the next generation of high-capacity
batteries. As we attempt to determine why they suffer such short lifespans, 
`resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonant_inelastic_X-ray_scattering>`_ experiments, an advanced
X-ray spectroscopy technique, have suggested Li-excess cathodes may produce
molecular oxygen that becomes trapped inside the battery, leading to reduced capacity.

In 2025, Gao et al. published `"Clarifying the origin of molecular O_2 in cathode
oxides" <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-025-02144-7>`_, noting RIXS experiments show the presence of molecular
oxygen in non-Li-excess batteries incapable of producing these molecules as well. 
This implies these molecules are likely an artifact of the RIXS methodology itself rather than the 
battery process. This caused a shift in
interpretation and understanding that shed light on the need for reliable simulations
to compare with experimental results. The 
problem? Classical computers simply cannot handle RIXS simulation for significant system sizes. 

This is precisely the case made by Loaiza et al. in `"Quantum algorithm for simulating
resonant inelastic X-ray scattering in battery materials" <https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20270>`_. Here, a quantum algorithm
is put forward to tackle the problem of RIXS simulation
using a novel combination of :doc:`generalized quantum signal processing (GQSP)
<demos/tutorial_estimator_hamiltonian_simulation_gqsp>`, :doc:`amplitude
amplification <demos/tutorial_intro_amplitude_amplification>`, :doc:`quantum
amplitude estimation (QAE) <demos/iterative_quantum_amplitude_estimation>`, and
:doc:`quantum phase estimation (QPE) <demos/tutorial_qpe>`. This solution not only
addresses the typical resource limitations of classical computation, but unlocks
access to the quantum processes RIXS relies on.

Today, our goal will be to understand how these quantum building blocks work
together to make way for reliable RIXS simulation and begin to open the door for
more capable advanced materials discovery in the future. 

Laying the Groundwork for RIXS Simulation
=========================================
What is RIXS?
-------------
The goal of RIXS spectroscopy is to monitor how matter interacts with incident light. 
At a high level, RIXS involves a material being illuminated by 
X-ray photons with energy very close to a core electron's binding
energy (also known as the "absorption edge") [#Loaiza2026]_. The successful
absorption of this photon with frequency :math:`\omega_I` kicks off a cascade
process in which the absorbed photon promotes a core electron to a valence
orbital, leaving behind a hole in the core orbital that is eventually filled by
a different, lower-energy valence electron.

Though this simple explanation is sufficient to understand our observables,
it obscures the fact that RIXS is fundamentally a second-order quantum scattering
process. This means the intermediate state (which exists between the ground
state and final excited state) is actually a coherent collection of virtual states.
So, technically no collapse occurs, but it can be treated
as its own state for practical purposes.

   *Energy level diagrams for the full RIXS process*

The difference between the final energy eigenvalue :math:`E_f` and 
the initial energy eigenvalue :math:`E_0` is known as the **energy
loss**. When energy loss versus intensity is plotted (as is characteristic of a
RIXS spectrum), each spectral peak can be interpreted as a specific excitation within the
target system. The energy values at which these peaks occur indicate what is present in a reaction,
allowing for correlation between observed excitation peaks and known molecular excitation
energies for identification.

The Hamiltonian
---------------
.. admonition:: A note on operators
   :class: note

   When describing electrons in a molecular system represented using second-quantization, 
   it is conventional to use :doc:`Fermionic
   operators <demos/tutorial_fermionic_operators>` to describe the behaviour of
   the indistinguishable particles that make up the system. In general, the operators of
   concern are:

   |

   1. :math:`\hat{c}_i^\dagger`, the **creation operator**. This is used when an electron
      is "created", effectively occupying some orbital :math:`i`.
   2. :math:`\hat{c}_i`, the **annihilation operator**. This is used when an electron is
      "destroyed", effectively vacating some orbital :math:`i`.

   |

   Combining these operators for a given orbital yields **number operators**,
   which "count" the number of electrons occupying a given orbital:

   .. math::
      \hat{n}_i=\hat{c}^\dagger_i \hat{c}_i


Loaiza et al. focus on a second-quantized Hamiltonian of
the form

.. math::
   \hat{H}=E^{0}+\sum_{p,q=1}^{N_{a}}\sum_{\sigma\in \{\uparrow, \downarrow\}}h_{pq}\hat{c}_{p\sigma}^{\dagger}\hat{c}_{q\sigma}+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{p,q,r,s=1}^{N_{a}}\sum_{\sigma,\sigma '\in \{\uparrow, \downarrow\}}V_{pqrs}\hat{c}_{p\sigma}^{\dagger}\hat{c}_{q\sigma}\hat{c}_{r\sigma^{\prime}}^{\dagger}\hat{c}_{s\sigma^{\prime}},

where :math:`N_a` is the number of active orbitals used in the simulation, :math:`p,
q, r,` and :math:`s` are specific orbital indices, :math:`\sigma` and
:math:`\sigma^\prime` are spin states, :math:`h_{pq}` are the one-electron
integrals, :math:`V_{pqrs}` are the two-electron integrals, 
and :math:`E^0` is the total energy of the inner-shell electrons, which are approximated as frozen in the active
space definition. 

For our purposes, we will not apply this Hamiltonian structure
to the :math:`\textrm{MnO}_7\textrm{H}_6` molecule that the source paper focuses on. Instead, we
will take a basic system consisting of two core orbitals and two valence
orbitals to be our focus, given as

.. math::
   \hat{H}=\sum_{\sigma\in \{\uparrow, \downarrow\}}(\epsilon_{c_1}\hat{n}_{c_1,\sigma}+\epsilon_{c_2}\hat{n}_{c_2,\sigma}+\epsilon_{\nu_1}\hat{n}_{\nu_1,\sigma}+\epsilon_{\nu_2}\hat{n}_{\nu_2,\sigma})+h\sum_{\sigma\in \{\uparrow, \downarrow\}}(\hat{c}_{\nu_1,\sigma}^\dagger\hat{c}_{\nu_2,\sigma}+\hat{c}_{\nu_2,\sigma}^{\dagger}\hat{c}_{\nu_1,\sigma})+V(\hat{n}_{\nu_2,\uparrow}\hat{n}_{\nu_2,\downarrow}),

where :math:`c_1` and :math:`c_2` are core orbitals, :math:`\nu_1` and
:math:`\nu_2` are valence orbitals, and :math:`\epsilon_i` are on-site orbital
energies. Note that the :math:`\sum_{p,q=1}^{N_{a}}\sum_{\sigma\in \{\uparrow, \downarrow\}}h_{pq}\hat{c}_{p\sigma}^{\dagger}\hat{c}_{q\sigma}`
term has been explicitly broken up into the diagonal (first term) and off-diagonal (second term) components in 
our Hamiltonian.

To implement this Hamiltonian in PennyLane, we can first call the built-in
Fermionic operators :class:`~pennylane.FermiC` (the creation operator) and
:class:`~pennylane.FermiA` (the annihilation operator). These will be used 
to construct the required number operators.

#
# The Algorithm
# =============
# Algorithm Overview
# ------------------
# To carry out a quantum simulation of a RIXS spectrum, Loaiza et al. summarize
# their algorithm in two steps:
# 
# 1. Prepare the initial RIXS state :math:`|R_{\epsilon_I,\epsilon_S}(\omega_I)\rangle`,
# 2. Carry out a walk-based :doc:`quantum phase estimation (QPE) <demos/tutorial_qpe>` procedure to read the final state.
#
# Item 1 on this list does a lot of heavy lifting here. In fact, the process of
# preparing the state dominantly contributes to the overall cost of the algorithm. So, we can expand the
# list to capture the complete methodology:
# 
# 1. Prepare the initial RIXS state, :math:`|R_{\epsilon_I,\epsilon_S}(\omega_I)\rangle`, in which we:
# 
#    * Construct a PREP-SEL-PREP block-encoding of the Hamiltonian, from which we have direct access to the associated qubitized walk operator, 
#
#    * Implement a Green's function spectral filter using GQSP with the walk operator :math:`\hat G(\omega_I,\Gamma) \approx \sum_k w_k \hat W^k`, which amounts to finding the Chebyshev coefficients of the Green's function and translating them to angles for implementation, 
#
#    * Define incoming and outgoing polarization to obtain the associated **dipole operators** :math:`\hat{D}_{\epsilon_i}`, which capture, within the dipole approximation, the perturbation that occurs as a result of the incident excitation and outgoing relaxation, 
#
#    * Prepare a block-encoding :math:`\hat{\mathcal{U}}` of the operator effectively proportional to :math:`\hat{D}_{\epsilon_S}^\dagger \hat{G}(\omega_I, \Gamma) \hat{D}_{\epsilon_I}`, 
#
#    * Construct a :doc:`Grover operator <demos/tutorial_grovers_algorithm>` using :math:`\hat{\mathcal{U}}` and carry out amplitude estimation to determine the success probability of the block-encoding step, 
#
#    * Carry out :doc:`amplitude amplification <demos/tutorial_intro_amplitude_amplification>` on the successful block encoded state to boost the success probability,
# 
# 2. Carry out a walk-based QPE to read the final state.

#    :alt: An illustrated circuit diagram depicting the general components of Loaiza et al.'s algorithm.
#
#    *The entire RIXS circuit involves preparing the RIXS state and executing walk-based QPE*
#
# We have our work cut out for us! Thankfully, most of the tools we need are
# built for us in PennyLane, so let us work through these steps systematically
# to reach our goal. 
#
# Resource Definition
# ...................
# Based on the algorithm
# outline, we will build our functions using 
# a total of 8 registers, each of which requires a different number of wires. 
#
# The GQSP register, success flag register, and block-encoding ancilla
# register only require one wire each. The number of wires included in the QPE walk
# register, GQSP walk register, and the ancilla registers used for qubitization can be defined according to 
# desired precision. The system register should have the same number of qubits
# as the system has active spin-orbitals, which is twice the number of spatial 
# orbitals.
#
# The remaining two registers (the QAE wires and the QPE wires, which facilitate 
# separate circuits) should be
# computed relative to the desired accuracy and resolution of the spectral
# output. The number of wires in the QAE register can be found via the general
# expression:
#
# .. math:: 
#    \lceil \log_2(1/\epsilon) \rceil,
#
# where :math:`\epsilon` is the target precision.
#
# It is defined in the source paper that the QPE register is given by
#
# .. math:: 
#    \lceil \log_2(N(\epsilon_\omega)) \rceil,
#
# where 
# 
# .. math::
#    N(\epsilon_\omega)=\left\lceil \frac{\pi\lambda}{\sqrt{2}\epsilon_\omega}\right\rceil.
#
# So, we can define our thresholds and compute our register sizes, initializing the
# full set of system registers using :func:`~pennylane.registers`.

# BLISS-THC Decomposition 
# -----------------------
# In order to carry out subsequent block-encoding and minimize resource costs,
# the target Hamiltonian needs to be decomposed into a :doc:`linear
# combination of unitaries (LCU) <demos/tutorial_lcu_blockencoding>` for block-encoding.
#
# Loaiza et al. select the block-invariant symmetry-shift technique with
# tensor hypercontraction factorization (BLISS-THC) method for their
# decomposition, which is known to be well-suited for compressing molecular
# Hamiltonians [#Caesura2025]_. 
# The THC Hamiltonian [#Lee2021]_
# specifically can be implemented natively in PennyLane :doc:`resource estimation <demos/tutorial_re_for_qubitizedQPE>`
# tasks using :class:`~pennylane.estimator.compact_hamiltonian.THCHamiltonian`.
#
# Luckily, we do not need to worry about this as our toy model is simple enough. Onward!
#
# Operator Preparation
# --------------------
# The overarching goal of the state preparation component of the algorithm is to create the
# RIXS state
#
# .. math:: |R_{\epsilon_I,
#    \epsilon_S}(\omega_I)\rangle\equiv\frac{\hat{R}_{\epsilon_I,
#    \epsilon_S}(\omega_I)|E_0\rangle}{|R_{\epsilon_I,\epsilon_S}(\omega_I)|},
#
# where :math:`|R_{\epsilon_I,\epsilon_S}(\omega_I)|` is the norm of the state. 
# We will take for granted that this state is equivalent to the block-encoded
# operator
#
# .. math:: \hat{\mathcal{U}}_R \equiv \begin{bmatrix}
#    \frac{\Gamma}{\lambda_D^{(\epsilon_S)}} D_{\epsilon_S}^\dagger
#    \hat{G}(\omega_I, \Gamma) \hat{U}_{\epsilon_I} & \cdot \\ \cdot & \cdot
#    \end{bmatrix},
#
# where :math:`\Gamma` is the inverse of the intermediate state lifetime in units of
# energy, :math:`D_{\epsilon_S}^\dagger` is the
# final state dipole operator, :math:`\lambda_D^{(\epsilon_S)}` is the 1-norm of
# the final state dipole operator, :math:`\hat{G}(\omega_I, \Gamma)` is the
# Green's function, and :math:`\hat{U}_{\epsilon_I}` is an operator that maps the
# initial dipole-perturbed state onto the all-zero state, giving
# :math:`\hat{U}_{\epsilon_I}|0\rangle=|D_{\epsilon_I}\rangle` [#Loaiza2026]_. So, our main
# goal for now is to gather the building blocks of the embedded unitary operator
# and construct this block-encoding representation.
#
# The Dipole Operator
# ...................
# For a given polarization :math:`\epsilon`, the (one-electron) dipole operator can be generally defined as
# 
# .. math::
#    \hat{D}_{\epsilon}=\sum_{pq}\sum_{\sigma\in \{\uparrow, \downarrow\}}d_{pq}^{(\epsilon)}\hat{c}_{p\sigma}^\dagger\hat{c}_{q\sigma}+\text{h.c.},
#
# where :math:`d_{pq}^{(\epsilon)}` are the dipole matrix elements. For simplicity, we do not consider different polarizations in our toy model.
#
# Since the total dipole operator (containing both the excitation and de-excitation terms) is necessarily Hermitian, we can represent it as 
# 
# .. math::
#    \hat{D}=\hat{D}_{exc}+\hat{D}_{exc}^\dagger.
#
# Thus, we can define the excitation operator using our Fermi operators and construct our total operator.

# Green's Function and GQSP
# .........................
# Even though RIXS is formally a second-order process that yields
# a two dimensional spectrum, Loaiza
# et al. chose to focus on the quantum simulation of high-resolution
# RIXS spectra for selected incoming photon frequencies, in line with the
# experimental requirements [#Loaiza2024]_. The selection frequencies of
# interest is done using a
# frequency-specific Green's function, which acts as a spectral filter.
#
# The Green's function is given by
# 
# .. math::
#    \Gamma\hat{G}(\omega_I,\Gamma)=\frac{\Gamma}{\omega_I-(\hat{H}-E_0)+i\Gamma}.
# 
# Note that the :math:`\Gamma` factor represents a physical broadening caused by the 
# finite lifetimes of the intermediate states we discussed previously. 
#
# To use GQSP, the phase factor angles, which dictate
# how a target function can be encoded onto a system,
# must first be found. This is a completely classical process that involves
# determining the `Chebyshev coefficients
# <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials>`_ and converting them
# into an angle representation for use. ``AngleFinder()`` handles this, taking
# advantage of python and PennyLane tools (such as
# :func:`~pennylane.poly_to_angles`, which handles the conversion as long as the
# found polynomial is represented in the Fourier basis) to get the job done. 
#
# For a given target accuracy, the Chebyshev expansion of the Green's function
# will have an associated polynomial degree of :math:`K_G`, as fully explained in
# Appendix A of [#Loaiza2026]_. A higher degree will result in a higher-order
# polynomial expansion, yielding higher resolution.
#
# To carry out our GQSP and eventual state encoding, we will need to extract some
# important parameters from our Hamiltonian. This includes the eigenvalues and 
# eigenvectors (which are useful tools for benchmarking) and the 1-norm.

# the spectrum can be centered around zero and that the 1-norm is reduced. Overall,
# doing this makes our problem cheaper since the associated shift can be effectively

# With these parameters found, we can determined the coefficients of our Green's function,

# Block-Encoding
# ..............

#    on the system register,
# 2. Carry out the GQSP process, 
# 3. Block-encode the final conjugate dipole operator :math:`D^\dagger` onto the system
#    register (the de-excitation step that fills the core hole),
# 4. Carry out a controlled X operation that will flag if all

#
# Amplitude Estimation and Amplification
# --------------------------------------
# To improve outcomes, Loaiza et al.
# use amplitude amplification on to guarantee the successful RIXS block encoding
# is selected in the state generation process. They note that, while you can carry out
# amplification without prior knowledge of the success probability :math:`P_R`
# via fixed-point amplitude amplification,
# it is "advantageous to first determine :math:`P_R` and then use 'textbook'
# amplitude amplification" [#Loaiza2026]_. 
#
# :doc:`Amplitude estimation
# <demos/iterative_quantum_amplitude_estimation>` is the process of determining
# the proportion of a specific "good" state in a data set. In this context, the
# estimation process should give the probability of the block-encoding step
# returning a successful block-encoding, as marked by the success flag mentioned
# earlier. :doc:`Amplitude amplification
# <demos/tutorial_intro_amplitude_amplification>`, on the other hand, carries
# out a series of strategic reflections that increase the relative probability
# of measuring the success state.
#
# They define the true success probability as
#
# .. math:: P_R \equiv \left( \frac{\Gamma |R_{\epsilon_I,\epsilon_S}(\omega_I)|}{\lambda_D^{(\epsilon_S)} |D_{\epsilon_I}|}\right)^2.
#
# Which can be used to determine the number of amplitude amplification steps
# :math:`K_A` via
#
# .. math:: 
#    K_A = \left\lfloor \frac{\pi}{4\arcsin\sqrt{P_R}} \right\rfloor.
#
# So, if we are able to determine the success probability, we can easily compute
# the amplitude amplification repetition parameter, boost our signal, and move
# forward to our QPE step with confidence.

# Quantum Phase Estimation and Readout
# ------------------------------------
# Following state preparation, the second step of the algorithm is the application of walk-based QPE, which is the final piece
# of the puzzle in Loaiza et al.'s RIXS simulation. This operator
# is defined as
#
# .. math:: \hat{\mathcal{W}}=\hat{\mathcal{R}}\cdot \text{PREP}^\dagger \cdot
#    \text{SEL} \cdot \text{PREP},
#
# where :math:`\hat{\mathcal{R}}=(\hat{I}-2|0\rangle\langle0|)\otimes\hat{I}`
# [#Loaiza2026]_. This can be taken as an implementable, efficient
# representation of the walk operator :math:`e^{\pm i \arccos
# \hat{H}/\lambda}`. Carrying
# out controlled applications of the walk operator between the QPE register
# and the state register results in a phase 
#
# .. math::
#    \theta_f = \pm\arccos(E_f/\lambda), 
#
# where :math:`E_f` is an eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian,
# being kicked back onto the QPE register for readout.
# 
# The Kaiser Window
# .................
# Prior to the walk operator, an operator
# :math:`\mathcal{L}_\delta` operates on the QPE register. This encodes a
# `Kaiser lineshape <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_window>`_, 
# replacing the sinc lineshape produced by the typical Hadamard initialization, which has long tails
# and leads to worse convergence.
#
# With that, we're ready to rock! Or, more accurately, we're ready to walk.

# Note that the amplitude estimation and amplification steps were skipped here
# for computational simplicity. ``HighProbRIXSState()`` can easily replace 
# ``RIXSStateEncodingUnitary()`` at the beginning of the function, where
# the number of calls to amplitude amplification inside ``HighProbRIXSState()``
# would be determined by the amplitude estimation step.
#
# Some Notes on Plotting
# ......................
# When constructing the final RIXS
# spectrum from the algorithm output, it is noted by Loaiza et al. that a
# convolution step is taken to smooth the output, which involves a Dirac delta
# function as a result of the differential representation of the RIXS amplitude,
# given by
#
# .. math:: P_{\epsilon_I, \epsilon_S}(\omega_I,\omega)=\sum_f ||\langle E_f|\hat{R}_{\epsilon_I,\epsilon_S}(\omega_I)|E_0\rangle||^2\delta(\omega-(E_f-E_0)).
#
# To achieve this, the authors apply a `Lorentzian
# <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line_shape>`_ with width :math:`\eta=0.2` eV to
# smooth and account for expected broadening in a realistic system.
#
# An additional, relevant trick is the use of **spectral folding**. This compensates for the fact that the
# eigenvalues of the walk operator are :math:`e^{\pm i \arccos(E/\lambda)}`, meaning the 
# phases the QPE step reads out are :math:`\pm \arccos(E/\lambda)`. This means the QPE
# output is mirror symmetric about the middle bin since each energy value appears in both the 
# :math:`+\theta` and :math:`-\theta` phase branches. Folding recombines each mirrored pair
# into a single bin, which prevents double counting and enables accurate value extraction prior to the plotting process.

#    *Prior to folding, the QPE output shows a mirrored set of phase
#    values as a result of the mirrored phase branches of the qubitized walk

#
# Finally, the spectral output should be plotted in terms of recovered energy loss (:math:`E_f-E_0`) versus normalized intensity. The recovered energy loss is given by Loaiza et al. as 
#
# .. math::
#    \lambda\cos(\theta_f)-E_0

# Interpreting the Results
# ========================
# Since we are dealing with a small toy model, it is easy for us to plot the
# analytical solution of the RIXS spectrum for comparison. This can be achieved
# via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix.

#
#    *Simulated spectrum*
#
# As shown, the peaks occur at approximately the same energy loss value
# with similar intensity in both plots. This was achieved with an :math:`n_\omega=8` value that takes approximately 4 hours to converge.
# 
# Upon inspection, it is clear that the two plots are not perfectly aligned, though. The result
# is pretty good, but when we are striving for precision for high-importance validations, accuracy
# is everything. Since we
# made no impactful physical assumptions about our system in our implementation, why is this the 
# case?
#
# The main culprit here is the value of :math:`n_\omega`, which defines the size of the
# QPE register. As the size of this register increases, the angle bins that the QPE
# read out fall into shrink, resulting in higher resolution. Thus, a maximized register size
# leads to the most accurate results. Unfortunately, increasing this register size
# exponentially increases the size of the simulation, meaning computational resources
# are quickly exhausted on classical devices.

#
# These plots depict two peaks, the elastic peak (centered at 0) and the inelastic
# peak (centered at 2.745). The inelastic peak is the value of interest in the battery
# experiments we discussed previously. The frequency at which this peak occurs can
# be compared to known resonance frequencies of various molecules to determine what
# is present in a chemical process. 
#
# Conclusion
# ==========
# The problem of RIXS simulation is a clear example of
# gap in computational capability causing confusion in cutting-edge research
# that can be addressed specifically by the capabilities of quantum algorithms.
# Chasing opportunities such as these is a first step in creating a
# quantum-ready future. 
#
# This algorithms is a great demonstration of how cutting-edge algorithms 
# can be constructed out of well known, established components. Its worthwhile
# to acquaint yourself with these puzzle pieces, especially the methods
# linked in this demo. It is never too late to go back to basics!

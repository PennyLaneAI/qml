Simulating Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering
##############################################

Our understanding of reality is only as accurate as our models. Our models are only as accurate as our ability to interpret their
results.

Lithium excess (Li-excess)
batteries are currently being eyed as the next generation of high-capacity
batteries. In an attempt to determine why they boast such short lifespans, 
**resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS)** experiments, an advanced
X-ray spectroscopy technique, have indicated that Li-excess cathodes produce
molecular oxygen that becomes trapped inside the battery, leading to decline.

In 2025, Gao et al. published "Clarifying the origin of molecular O2 in cathode
oxides", dropping the bombshell that RIXS experiments show the presence of molecular
oxygen in non-Li-excess batteries incapable of producing these molecules as well, 
meaning it is likely an artifact of the methodology itself. They additionally
point to this as evidence of a much more complex degradation mechanism involving
the bonding of oxygen dimers to transition metals in the battery materials.

Though this wasn't necessarily a "back to the drawing board" moment, this shift in
interpretation and understanding shed light on the need for reliable simulations
that can help with the validation and interpretation of experimental results. The 
problem? Classical computers simply cannot handle RIXS simulation for significant system sizes. 

This is precisely the case made by Loaiza et al. in "Quantum algorithm for simulating
resonant inelastic X-ray scattering of battery materials". Here, a quantum algorithm
is put forward to tackle the problem of RIXS simulation
using a novel combination of :doc:`generalized quantum signal processing (GQSP)
<demos/tutorial_estimator_hamiltonian_simulation_gqsp>`, :doc:`amplitude
amplification <demos/tutorial_intro_amplitude_amplification>`, :doc:`quantum
amplitude estimation (QAE) <demos/iterative_quantum_amplitude_estimation>`, and
:doc:`quantum phase estimation (QPE) <demos/tutorial_qpe>`. This solution not only
addresses the typical resource limitations of classical computation, but unlocks
access to the quantum processes that RIXS relies on.

Today, our goal will be to understand how these quantum building blocks work
together to make way for reliable RIXS simulation and begin to open the door for
more capable advanced materials discovery in the future. After working through 
this demo, you should be better acquainted with RIXS and its simulation potential.
Let's get to work!

Getting Started
===============
What is RIXS?
-------------
The goal of RIXS spectroscopy is to monitor how matter interacts with light. 
At a high level, RIXS involves a material being illuminated by 
X-ray photons with energy very close to a core electron's binding
energy (also known as the "absorption edge") [#Loaiza2026]_. The successful
absorption of this photon with frequency :math:`\omega_I` kicks off a two-step
process in which the absorbed photon promotes a core electron to a valence
orbital, leaving behind a hole in the core orbital that is eventually filled by
a different, lower energy valence electron. This is why RIXS is coined a "photon-in, 
photon-out" process, since the relaxation of the second valence electron into the 
core releases a photon of frequency :math:`\omega_S` that is detected 
and used to compute the difference between the input and output photon energies.

Though this simple explanation is sufficient to understand the observables,
it obscures the fact that RIXS is fundamentally a second-order quantum scattering
process. This means that the intermediate state (which exists between the ground
state and final excited state) is actually a coherent collection of virtual states.
This means the system never actually collapses to this intermediate state, further 
emphasizing the need for quantum effects to be properly emulated.

   :width: 700px
   :alt: An illustration of the three stages of the RIXS process in the form of an energy level diagram.

   *Energy level diagrams for the full RIXS process*

So, the three states involved in the RIXS process are:

1. :math:`|E_0\rangle`: The molecule sits in an unexcited state prior to the absorption of the incident :math:`\omega_I` photon.
2. :math:`|E_n\rangle`: Following the absorption of the incident :math:`\omega_I` photon, a core electron has been excited to a higher-energy valence orbital leaving behind a core hole.
3. :math:`|E_f\rangle`: To fill the unfavourable core hole, an electron from a lower energy valence orbital has relaxed into the core, leaving behind a valence hole and emitting a :math:`\omega_S` photon [#Loaiza2026]_. The molecule is left in an excited state.

The difference between :math:`E_f` and :math:`E_0` is known as the **energy
transfer**. When energy transfer versus intensity is plotted (as is characteristic of a
RIXS spectrum), the spectral peaks can be interpreted as a specific excitation within the
target system. The energy values at which these peaks occur indicate what exactly is present,
allowing for correlation between observed excitation peaks and known molecular excitation
energies for identification.

Why Quantum?
------------
Classical simulation is limited in the amount and type of complexity it can
handle. Basic comparisons of classical and quantum simulation methods tend to make the
case that the maximum compatible system size varies greatly between the two, 
with quantum simulations typically capable of handling many more
states. While this is generally true, there are additional, potentially more important
advantages that are not merely reliant on an increase in computational power. In
the case of Loaiza et al.'s RIXS algorithm, the following two advantages are
listed for the quantum case:

1. RIXS spectroscopy involves several **delocalized processes**, meaning the positions
   of the electrons involved are probabilistically spread out across the
   molecule. Capturing this requires a large active space that simply cannot be constructed 
   by classical bits incapable of emulating superposition and entanglement relationships.

2. Strongly correlated systems of interest, such as the transition metal-oxygen
   dimer bonding proposed by Gao et al., experience complex intermediate states
   that dictate the mixing of orbitals in the oxygen-metal bonding process. To
   model this sufficiently, any computationally simple wavefunction is
   insufficient, and a classical computer is once again incapable of carrying
   out the necessary entanglement math [#Loaiza2026]_.

So, even though it *is* a valid argument to say that quantum computers could
more feasibly handle large molecules if necessary, the stronger arguments in
this context is that the use of qubits to carry out RIXS simulation makes it
inherently possible to model the quantum phenomena that the technique relies on. Good thing
we know our stuff!

The Hamiltonian
---------------
.. admonition:: A note on operators
   :class: note

   When describing electrons in a molecular system represented using second-quantization, 
   it is conventional to use :doc:`Fermionic
   operators <demos/tutorial_fermionic_operators>` to describe the behaviour of
   the indistinguishable particles that make up the system. In general, the operators of
   concern are:

   |

   1. :math:`\hat{a_i^\dagger}`, the **creation operator**. This is used when a particle
      is "created", effectively occupying some orbital.
   2. :math:`\hat{a_i}`, the **annihilation operator**. This is used when a particle is
      "destroyed", effectively vacating some orbital.

   |

   Combining these operators for a given orbital yields **number operators**,
   which "count" the number of electrons occupying a given orbital:

   .. math::
      \hat{n}_i=a^\dagger_i a_i


In "Quantum algorithm for simulating resonant inelastic X-ray scattering of
battery materials", Loaiza et al. focus on a second-quantized Hamiltonian of
the form

.. math::
   \hat{H}=E^{0}+\sum_{p,q=1}^{N_{a}}\sum_{\sigma\in \{\uparrow, \downarrow\}}h_{pq}\hat{a}_{p\sigma}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_{q\sigma}+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{p,q,r,s=1}^{N_{a}}\sum_{\sigma,\sigma '\in \{\uparrow, \downarrow\}}V_{pqrs}\hat{a}_{p\sigma}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_{q\sigma}\hat{a}_{r\sigma^{\prime}}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_{s\sigma^{\prime}},

where :math:`N_a` is the number of active orbitals used in the simulation, :math:`p,
q, r,` and :math:`s` are specific orbital indices, :math:`\sigma` and
:math:`\sigma^\prime` are spin states, :math:`h_{pq}` are the one-electron
integrals, :math:`V_{pqrs}` are the two-electron integrals, 
and :math:`E^0` is the total energy of the inner-shell electrons, which are approximated as frozen in the active
space definition. 

Let's make things a bit simpler. For our purposes, we will not apply this complex Hamiltonian structure
to the :math:`MnO_7H_6` molecule that the source paper focuses on. Instead, we
will take a simple system consisting of two core orbitals and two valence
orbitals to be our focus. To do this, we will adapt the given Hamiltonian as

.. math::
   \hat{H}=\sum_{\sigma\in \{\uparrow, \downarrow\}}(\epsilon_{c1}\hat{n}_{c1,\sigma}+\epsilon_{c2}\hat{n}_{c2,\sigma}+\epsilon_{\nu_1}\hat{n}_{\nu_1,\sigma}+\epsilon_{\nu_2}\hat{n}_{\nu_2,\sigma})+h\sum_{\sigma\in \{\uparrow, \downarrow\}}(\hat{c}_{\nu_1,\sigma}^\dagger\hat{c}_{\nu_2,\sigma}+\hat{c}_{\nu_2,\sigma}^{\dagger}\hat{c}_{\nu_1,\sigma})+V\sum_{\sigma\in \{\uparrow, \downarrow\}}\hat{n}_{\nu_2,\sigma}

where :math:`c_1` and :math:`c_2` are core orbitals, :math:`\nu_1` and
:math:`\nu_2` are valence orbitals, and :math:`\epsilon_i` are on-site orbital
energies. Note that the :math:`\sum_{p,q=1}^{N_{a}}\sum_{\sigma\in \{\uparrow, \downarrow\}}h_{pq}\hat{c}_{p\sigma}^{\dagger}\hat{c}_{q\sigma}`
term has been explicitly broken up into the diagonal (first term) and off-diagonal (second term) components in 
our Hamiltonian.

To implement this Hamiltonian in PennyLane, we can first call the built in
Fermionic operators :class:`~pennylane.FermiC` (the creation operator) and
:class:`~pennylane.FermiA` (the annihilation operator). These will be used 
to construct the required number operators.

# The Algorithm
# =============
# Algorithm Overview
# ------------------
# To carry out a quantum simulation of a RIXS spectrum, Loaiza et al. summarize
# their algorithm in two steps:
# 
# 1. Prepare the initial RIXS state :math:`|R_{\epsilon_I,\epsilon_S}(\omega_I)\rangle`,
# 2. Carry out a walk-based :doc:`quantum phase estimation <demos/tutorial_qpe>` to read the final state.

#    :alt: An illustrated circuit diagram depicting the general components of Loaiza et al.'s algorithm.
#
#    *The entire RIXS circuit involves preparing the RIXS state and executing walk-based QPE*
#
# Item 1 on this list does a lot of heavy lifting here. In fact, the process of
# preparing the state *is* the algorithm in many ways. So, we can expand the
# list to capture the complete methodology:
# 
# 1. Prepare the initial RIXS state, :math:`|R_{\epsilon_I,\epsilon_S}(\omega_I)\rangle`
# 
#    a. Construct a PREP-SEL-PREP block-encoding of the Hamiltonian, from which we have 
#    direct access to the associated qubitized walk operator, 
#
#    b. Implement a Green's function spectral filter
#    using GQSP with the walk operator :math:\hat G(\omega_I,\Gamma) \approx \sum_k w_k \hat W^k, 
#    which amounts to finding the Chebyshev
#    coefficients of the Green's function and translating them to angles for
#    implementation, 
#
#    c. Define the **dipole operator**
#    :math:`\hat{D}_{\epsilon_i}`, which captures, within the dipole approximation, the perturbation that occurs
#    as a result of the incident photon excitation, 
#
#    d. Prepare a block-encoding
#    :math:`\hat{\mathcal{U}}` of the operator proportional to
#    :math:`\hat{D}_{\epsilon_S}^\dagger \hat{G}(\omega_I, \Gamma)
#    \hat{D}_{\epsilon_I}`, 
#
#    e. Construct a :doc:`Grover operator
#    <demos/tutorial_grovers_algorithm>` using :math:`\hat{\mathcal{U}}` and
#    carry out amplitude estimation to determine the success probability of the
#    block-encoding step, 
#
#    f. Carry out :doc:`amplitude amplification
#    <demos/tutorial_intro_amplitude_amplification>` on the successful block
#    encoded state to boost the success probability,
# 
# 2. Carry out a walk-based :doc:`quantum phase estimation <demos/tutorial_qpe>` to
#    read the final state.
#
# We have our work cut out for us! Thankfully, most of the tools we need are
# built for us in PennyLane, so let us work through these steps systematically
# to reach our goal. 
#
# Resource Definition 
# ................... 
# Before we jump in, some bookkeeping is in order. Based on the algorithm
# outling, we will build our functions using 
# a total of 9 registers, each of which has a different number of wires. 
#
# The GQSP register, success flag register, and two block-encoding ancilla
# registers only require one wire each. The number of wires included in the QPE
# register and the ancilla registers used for qubitization can vary depending on the
# desired precision. The system register should have the same number of qubits
# as the system has active spin-orbitals, which is twice the number of spatial 
# orbitals.
#
# The remaining two registers (the QAE wires and the QPE wires) should be
# computed relative to the desired accuracy and resolution of the spectral
# output. The number of wires in the QAE register can be found via the general
# expression:
#
# .. math:: 
#    \lceil \log_2(1/\epsilon) \rceil.
#
# It is defined in the source paper that the QPE register is given by
#
# .. math:: 
#    \lceil \log_2(N(\epsilon_\omega)) \rceil,
#
# where 
# 
# .. math::
#    N(\epsilon_\omega)=\left\lciel \frac{\pi\lambda}{\sqrt{2}\epsilon_\omega},
# 
# where :math:`\epsilon_\omega` is the defined resolution of the register.
#
# So, we can define our thresholds and compute our register sizes, initializing the
# full set of system registers using :func:`~pennylane.registers`.

# BLISS-THC Decomposition 
# -----------------------
# In order to carry out subsequent block-encoding and minimize resource costs,
# the target Hamiltonian needs to be decomposed into a :doc:`linear
# combination of unitaries (LCU) <demos/tutorial_lcu_blockencoding>`. The main
# goal of this process is to *compress* the Hamiltonian, making it easier to
# implement using gates and more feasible to execute within available
# resources.
#
# Loaiza et al. select the block-invariant symmetry-shift technique with
# tensor hypercontraction factorization (BLISS-THC) method for their
# decomposition, which is known to be well-suited for compressing molecular
# Hamiltonians [#Caesura2025]_. 
# The THC Hamiltonian [#Lee2021]_
# specifically can be implemented natively in PennyLane :doc:`resource estimation <demos/tutorial_resource_estimation>`
# tasks using :class:`~pennylane.estimator.compact_hamiltonian.THCHamiltonian`.
#
# Luckily, we do not have to worry about this as our toy model is simple enough
# to not require compression. Onward!
#
# Operator Preparation
# --------------------
# The overarching goal of state preparation component of the algorithm is to create the
# RIXS state
#
# .. math:: |R_{\epsilon_I,
#    \epsilon_S}(\omega_I)\rangle\equiv\frac{\hat{R}_{\epsilon_I,
#    \epsilon_S}(\omega_I)|E_0\rangle}{|R_{\epsilon_I,\epsilon_S}(\omega_I)|}.
#
# We will take for granted that this state is equivalent to the block-encoded
# operator
#
# .. math:: \hat{\mathcal{U}}_R \equiv \begin{bmatrix}
#    \frac{\Gamma}{\lambda_D^{(\epsilon_S)}} D_{\epsilon_S}^\dagger
#    \hat{G}(\omega_I, \Gamma) \hat{U}_{\epsilon_I} & \cdot \\ \cdot & \cdot
#    \end{bmatrix}
#
# Where :math:`\Gamma` is the inverse of the intermediate state lifetime in units
# energy, :math:`D_{\epsilon_S}^\dagger` is the
# final state dipole operator, :math:`\lambda_D^{(\epsilon_S)}` is the 1-norm of
# the final state dipole operator, :math:`\hat{G}(\omega_I, \Gamma)` is the
# Green's function, and :math:`\hat{U}_{\epsilon_I}` an operator that maps the
# initial dipole perturbed state onto the all-zero state, giving
# :math:`\hat{U}_{\epsilon_I}|0\rangle=|D_{\epsilon_I}\rangle` [#Loaiza2026]_. So, our main
# goal for now is to gather the building blocks of the embedded unitary operator
# and construct this block-encoding representation.
#
# We're almost there, I promise!
#
# The Dipole Operator 
# ...................
# For a given polarization :math:`\epsilon`, the (one-electron) dipole operator can be generally defined as
# 
# .. math::
#    \hat{D}_{\epsilon}=\sum_{pq}\sum_{\sigma\in \{\uparrow, \downarrow\}}d_{pq}^{(\epsilon)}\hat{c}_{p\sigma}^\dagger\hat{c}_{q\sigma}+\text{h.c.},
#
# where :math:`d_{pq}^{(\epsilon)}` are the dipole matrix elements. Note that, for simplicity, we do not consider different polarizations in our toy model.
#
# Since the total dipole operator (containing both the excitation and de-excitation terms) is necessarily Hermitian, we can represent it as 
# 
# .. math::
#    \hat{D}=\hat{D}_{exc}+\hat{D}_{exc}^\dagger.
#
# Thus, we can define the excitation operator using our Fermi operators and construct our total operator.
# 

#Define dipole matrix elements

# Green's Function and GQSP 
# ......................... 
#
# Even though the RIXS process is formally a second-order spectroscopy, Loaiza
# et al. chose to instead focus on the quantum simulation of high-resolution
# RIXS spectra for selected incoming photon frequencies, in line with the
# experimental requirements. This is enabled given that the associated
# two-dimensional spectrum could be directly accessed through the usage of
# generalized QPE [#Loaiza2024]_. The selection of specific frequencies of
# interest was then done through the implementation of an associated
# frequency-specific Green's function, which acts as a spectral filter.
#
# The Green's function is given by
# 
# .. math::
#    \Gamma\hat{G}(\omega_I,\Gamma)=\frac{\Gamma}{\omega_I-(\hat{H}-E_0)+i\Gamma}.
# 
# Note that a :math:`\Gamma` factor has been added here to guarantee
# normalization and implementability via GQSP. To do so, the phase factor angles
# must first be determined. This is a completely classical process that involves
# determining the `Chebyshev coefficients
# <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials>`_ and converting them
# into an angle representation for use. ``AngleFinder()`` handles this, taking
# advantage of python and PennyLane tools (such as
# :func:`~pennylane.poly_to_angles`, which handles the conversion as long as the
# found polynomial is represented in the Fourier basis) to get the job done. 
#
# For a given target accuracy, the Chebyshev expansion of the Green's function
# will have an associated polynomial degree of K_G, as fully explained in
# Appendix A of [#Loaiza2026]_. A higher degree will result in a higher-order
# polynomial expansion, yeilding higher resolution.

# Block-Encoding .............. With the dipole operators defined and the GQSP
# angles found, we can finally carry out our block-encoding! To achieve this, we
# need to: 
#
# 1. Prepare the dipole-perturbed initial state :math:`U_\epsilon =
#    D_\epsilon|E_0\rangle / ||D_\epsilon|E_0\rangle||` 
#    (the state you get from the incoming photon's dipole operator acting on the

# With this implemented, we have our RIXS state ready!
# ``RIXSStateEncodingUnitary()`` walks through each of the states present in the
# RIXS process, as indicated in the comments. Since we will be using QPE for our
# readout, though, there are a few additional steps that can be taken to ensure
# the true, optimal outcome can be achieved.
#
# Amplitude Estimation and Amplification
# --------------------------------------
# So far, we have implemented a block-encoding of the RIXS state, having that
# our target outcome can be thought as running (walk-based) QPE on the RIXS
# state. Even though the QPE workflow could be run conditioned upon a successful
# application of the RIXS state block-encoding, Loaiza et al. instead chose to
# use amplitude amplification on this block-encoding to guarantee the success
# and reduce the overall runtime. They note that, while you can carry out
# amplification without prior knowledge of the success probability :math:`P_R`,
# it is "advantageous to first determine :math:`P_R` and then use "textbook"
# amplitude amplification ... which has better prefactors" [#Loaiza2026]_. 
#
# To quickly review, :doc:`amplitude estimation
# <demos/iterative_quantum_amplitude_estimation>` is the process of determining
# the proportion of a specific "good" state in a data set. In this context, the
# estimation process should give the probability of the block-encoding step
# returning a successful block-encoding, as marked by the success flag mentioned
# earlier. :doc:`Amplitude amplification
# <demos/tutorial_intro_amplitude_amplification>`, on the other hand, carries
# out a series of strategic reflections that increase the relative probability
# of measuring the success state.
#
# They define the true success probability as
#
# .. math:: P_R \equiv \left( \frac{\Gamma |R_{\epsilon_I,\epsilon_S}(\omega_I)|}{\lambda_D^{(\epsilon_S)} |D_{\epsilon_I}|}\right)^2.
#
# Which can be used to determine the number of amplitude amplification steps
# :math:`K_A` via
#
# .. math:: K_A = \left\lfloor \frac{\pi}{4\arcsin\sqrt{P_R}} \right\rfloor
#
# So, if we are able to determine the success probability, we can easily compute
# the amplitude amplification repetition parameter, boost our signal, and move
# forward to our QPE step with confidence.

# Quantum Phase Estimation and Readout
# ------------------------------------
# The second step of the algorithm we laid out
# previously is the application of walk-based QPE, which is the final piece
# of the puzzle in Loaiza et al.'s RIXS simulation. This operator
# is defined as
#
# .. math:: \hat{\mathcal{W}}=\hat{\mathcal{R}}\cdot \text{PREP}^\dagger \cdot
#    \text{SEL} \cdot \text{PREP},
#
# where :math:`\hat{\mathcal{R}}=(\hat{I}-2|0\rangle\langle0|)\otimes\hat{I}`
# [#Loaiza2026]_. This can be taken as an implementable, efficient
# representation of the walk operator :math:`e^{\pm i \arccos
# \hat{H}/\lambda}`. Carrying
# out controlled applications of the walk operator between the QPE register
# and the state register results in a phase :math:`\theta_f =
# \pm\arccos(E_f/\lambda)`, where :math:`E_f` is an eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian,
# being kicked back onto the QPE register for readout.
# 
# The Kaiser Window
# .................
# Prior to the walk operator, an operator
# :math:`\mathcal{L}_\delta` operates on the QPE register. This operator encodes a
# `Kaiser lineshape <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_window>`_, 
# replacing the typical sinc lineshape produced by the usual Hadamard initialization, which has long tails
# and leads to worse convergence. Loaiza et al. state that this is to reduce "errors coming
# from discretization and finite precision" [#Loaiza2026]_, which arise mainly
# from the incapability of our system to replicate an infinite Dirac delta
# function in the QPE step. 
#
# With that, we're ready to rock! Or, more accurately, we're ready to walk.

# Note that the amplitude estimation and amplification steps were skipped here
# for computational simplicity. ``HighProbRIXSState()`` can easily replace 
# ``RIXSStateEncodingUnitary()`` at the beginning of the function, where
# the number of calls to amplitude amplification inside ``HighProbRIXSState()``
# would be determined by the amplitude estimation step.
#
# Some Notes on Plotting 
# ...................... 
# When constructing the final RIXS
# spectrum from the algorithm output, it is noted by Loaiza et al. that a
# convolution step is taken to smooth the output, which involves a Dirac delta
# function as a result of the differential representation of the RIXS amplitude,
# given by
#
# .. math:: P_{\epsilon_I, \epsilon_S}(\omega_I,\omega)=\sum_f ||\langle E_f|\hat{R}_{\epsilon_I,\epsilon_S}(\omega_I)|E_0\rangle||^2\delta(\omega-(E_f-E_0)).
#
# To achieve this, the authors apply a `Lorentzian
# <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentzian>`_ with width :math:`\eta=0.2` eV to
# smooth and account for expected broadening in a realistic system.
#
# An additional, relevant trick is the use of **spectral folding**.  It compensates for the fact that the
# eigenvalues of the walk operator are :math:`e^{\pm i \arccos(E/\lambda)}`, meaning the 
# phases the QPE step reads out are :math:`\pm \arccos(E/\lambda)`. This means that the QPE
# output is mirror symmetric about the middle bin since each energy value appears in both the 
# :math:`+\theta` and :math:`-\theta` phase branches. Folding recombines each mirrored pair
# into a single physical energy.

#    *Prior to phase folding, the QPE output shows a mirrored set of phase

#
# Finally, the spectral output should be plotted in terms of recovered energy loss (:math:`E_f-E_0`) versus normalized intensity. The recovered energy loss is given by Loaiza et al. as 
#

#    \lambda\cos(\theta_f)-E_0

# Interpreting the Results
# ========================
# Since we are dealing with a small toy model, it is easy for us to plot the
# analytical solution of the RIXS spectrum for comparison. This can be achieved
# via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix.

# Upon inspection, it is clear that the two plots are not exactly aligned. In this 
# simulated case, the peak is shifted and wider than in the analytical case. Since we
# made no impactful assumptions about our system in our implementation, why is this the 
# case?
#
# The main culprit here is the value of :math:`n_\omega`, which defines the size of the
# QPE register. As the size of this register increases, the angle bins that the QPE
# read out fall in to shrink, resulting in higher resolution. Thus, a maximized register size
# leads to the most accurate results. Unfortunately, increasing this register size
# exponentially increases the size of the simulation, meaning computational resources
# are quickly exhausted on classical devices.

# Conclusion
# ==========
# Pursuing useful, accessible quantum technologies requires careful
# consideration of which applications and use cases are most important and well
# suited. The problem of RIXS simulation is a clear example of this, in which a
# gap in computational capability is causing confusion in cutting-edge research
# and can be addressed specifically by the capabilities of quantum algorithms.
# Chasing opportunities such as these are a first step in creating a
# quantum-ready future. The algorithm implementation here shows a simple example
# of a powerful algorithm, play around with it as you become better acquainted
# with the techniques used and explore larger molecules!

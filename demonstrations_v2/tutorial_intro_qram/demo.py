r"""Intro to quantum random access memory (QRAM)
============================================
 
Loading classical data into a quantum algorithm is often a nontrivial step of the computation.
Efficient data access is important in `quantum machine
learning <https://pennylane.ai/qml/quantum-machine-learning/>`__, search algorithms, and :doc:`state
preparation <demos/tutorial_initial_state_preparation/>`. In this
demonstration, we introduce quantum random access memory (QRAM), a data-loading model that addresses
this problem from a more architectural perspective. This is already familiar from :doc:`quantum read-only
memory (QROM) <demos/tutorial_intro_qrom/>`, where a classical table of
bitstrings is loaded into a target register; instead of treating the data as a fixed read-only
lookup table, QRAM is usually discussed as an addressable memory model that can be queried
coherently and, depending on the setting, extended toward read-write memory access.

# We will work with three QRAM constructions that are implemented in PennyLane:
# 
# - :class:`~.pennylane.SelectOnlyQRAM`,
#   the direct select-style construction that is closest to QROM,
# - :class:`~.pennylane.BBQRAM`, a
#   bucket-brigade architecture that routes a bus qubit through a binary tree, and
# - :class:`~.pennylane.HybridQRAM`, which
#   interpolates between the two by combining a select prefix with a smaller bucket-brigade tree.
# 
# For a collection of bitstrings :math:`b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_{N-1}` of length :math:`m`, each
# construction implements the same logical map:
# 
# .. math:: \text{QRAM}\lvert i\rangle \lvert 0^{\otimes m} \rangle = \lvert i\rangle \lvert b_i\rangle.
# 
# Our goal in this demo is not only to use these templates in PennyLane, but also to understand what
# tradeoff each one makes between qubit count, circuit depth, and architectural complexity.
# 
#    **Figure placeholder:** Add a side-by-side conceptual overview of the three constructions: a
#    direct address-controlled write for ``SelectOnlyQRAM``, a binary routing tree for ``BBQRAM``, and
#    a select-prefix plus smaller tree for ``HybridQRAM``.

# -------------
# 
# To keep the circuits readable, we will use four classical records, each encoded as a 3-bit string:
# 
# .. math:: [010, 111, 110, 000].
# 
# This choice gives us a 2-qubit address register and a 3-qubit target register. The address ``00``
# loads ``010``, the address ``01`` loads ``111``, and so on. We will reuse the same dataset
# throughout the demo so that the differences between the three constructions are entirely due to the
# QRAM architecture itself.

# Select-only QRAM
# ----------------
# 
# We start with the most direct construction. :class:`~.pennylane.SelectOnlyQRAM` applies the appropriate bit flips to
# the target register, controlled on the address register. Conceptually, this is the QRAM analogue of
# the select-style QROM story: if the address is :math:`i`, we apply the gates that write :math:`b_i`
# into the target wires.
# 
# More concretely, for every stored record whose :math:`j`-th data bit is :math:`1`, the circuit
# applies an address-controlled :math:`X` gate to target wire :math:`j`. This address-controlled
# operation is a multi-controlled :math:`X` gate: all address wires jointly control whether the target
# bit is flipped. Repeating this over all addresses and target positions implements the full lookup
# map.
# 
# This is the simplest way to think about data loading, and it is the closest construction to the QROM
# demo. The drawback is that the controls are global: every address bit participates in the selection
# logic for every stored record, so the circuit can require many costly multi-controlled operations.

# Bucket-brigade QRAM
# -------------------
# 
# The bucket-brigade idea reorganizes the problem. Instead of using one large global selection gadget,
# it stores routing information in a binary tree. At a high level, the query has three stages:
# 
# 1. **Address loading.** The address qubits are routed into the binary tree, where they set the
#    direction information along the path corresponding to the queried address.
# 2. **Data retrieval.** A bus qubit is routed through the tree using the stored direction
#    information. At the bottom of the tree, the circuit applies gates determined by the classical
#    data stored at that leaf, then routes the bus back out to load the requested bitstring into the
#    target register.
# 3. **Address unloading.** The address-loading operation is reversed so that the routing tree is
#    restored and the work wires can be reused.
# 
# In PennyLane, :class:`~.pennylane.BBQRAM` uses one bus wire plus three wires per internal node of the routing tree:
# 
# - one direction wire,
# - one left-port wire, and
# - one right-port wire.
# 
# If the address register has :math:`n` wires, then the work register must contain
# 
# .. math:: 1 + 3(2^n - 1)
# 
# additional wires. For our 2-qubit address register, that means ten work wires.
# 
#    **Figure placeholder:** Add a bucket-brigade tree diagram for a 2-bit address. Label the bus
#    wire, direction wires, left/right port wires, and the active path selected by one example
#    address.

# Hybrid QRAM
# -----------
# 
# :class:`~.pennylane.HybridQRAM` combines the previous two ideas. We split the address into a select prefix of size
# :math:`k` and a bucket-brigade suffix of size :math:`n-k`. The prefix chooses one block of the
# classical data, and a smaller bucket-brigade tree is reused inside that block. The PennyLane
# template follows the circuit-level select/bucket-brigade hybridization idea in [#hybridqram]_, while
# hybrid QRAM also appears in hardware-oriented architectures such as [#hardwareefficient]_.
# 
# This gives us a tunable family of constructions:
# 
# - small :math:`k` means more bucket-brigade behavior and a larger routing tree,
# - large :math:`k` means more select-style behavior and less routing overhead.
# 
# For our 2-qubit address register, the only nontrivial choice is :math:`k=1`: one address bit acts as
# the select prefix, while the remaining bit routes through a depth-1 bucket-brigade tree.
# 
#    **Figure placeholder:** Add a hybrid decomposition diagram showing the top :math:`k` address bits
#    selecting a block and the remaining :math:`n-k` bits driving a shared bucket-brigade subtree.

# Even in this small example, the qualitative pattern is already visible. :class:`~.pennylane.SelectOnlyQRAM` keeps the
# qubit count low but leans on address-wide control logic. :class:`~.pennylane.BBQRAM` introduces a dedicated memory
# architecture that can replace some of that global control with local routing. :class:`~.pennylane.HybridQRAM` then
# turns this into a tunable tradeoff through the parameter :math:`k`. For very small tables, this
# extra structure can look expensive; the purpose of the hybrid construction is to expose a design
# knob that becomes more useful as the address space grows.
# 
# Conclusion
# ----------
# 
# QRAM is not a single circuit pattern, but a family of architectures for loading classical data into
# quantum registers. ``SelectOnlyQRAM``, ``BBQRAM``, and ``HybridQRAM`` all implement the same
# abstract operation,
# 
# .. math:: \lvert i\rangle \lvert 0\rangle \mapsto \lvert i\rangle \lvert b_i\rangle,
# 
# but they do so with different architectural tradeoffs. The direct select-style construction keeps
# the width small, but pays for it with exponentially many address-wide controlled operations.
# Bucket-brigade QRAM moves in the opposite direction: it spends :math:`O(2^n)` auxiliary wires on a
# routing tree so that a query follows a local path through memory. Hybrid QRAM sits between these
# extremes, using :math:`k` select-prefix bits to shrink the routing tree while increasing the
# select-style part of the computation.
# 
# The main takeaway is that the logical data-loading task does not determine a unique circuit
# architecture. Instead, QRAM design is a choice between different kinds of resource tradeoff: narrow
# circuits with global controls, wide circuits with local routing, or hybrid circuits that interpolate
# between the two. This is precisely why QRAM is an interesting topic for quantum software: once the
# logical task is fixed, the implementation details become a question of architecture and resources
# rather than correctness alone.
